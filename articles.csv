politics,"Disney boss Bob Iger, ABC exec asked 'The View' hosts to cool it on politics: report",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/the-view-iger.png,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disney-boss-bob-iger-abc-exec-asked-the-view-hosts-cool-politics-report,"Disney CEO Bob Iger and other executives have reportedly asked the co-hosts of ""The View"" to turn down their heated political rhetoric.
Multiple Disney sources told The Daily Beast that both Iger and ABC News President Almin Karamehmedovic recently suggested that the all-female daytime talk show panel be less antagonistic on political issues, though the recommendation was reportedly not taken too seriously. The co-hosts of ""The View"" have become known as being some of President Donald Trump's fiercest media critics since he began his political career.
""This is what our audience wants. Isn't it gonna look kind of bad if we're all of a sudden not talking about politics?"" one source told the outlet, paraphrasing how the co-hosts replied to the ABC and Disney executives.
As the outlet reported, ""Karamehmedovic convened a meeting with 'The View's' executive producer Brian Teta and its hosts, and suggested the panel needed to broaden its conversations beyond its predominant focus on politics.""
The ABC News president pointed to successful, less political segments with famous guests and suggested the co-hosts focus on this kind of content.
The sources described how the show's hosts pushed back against the suggestion, with Ana Navarro reacting the most forcefully. She told the ABC News head that audiences want the hosts to speak out on political issues.
The sources stated that Navarro and her colleagues found the request ""silly"" and insisted they were going to ""keep doing their thing.""
They also spoke of a conversation that Navarro had with Iger during an event last week held by the ABC parent company intended to woo new advertisers.
The co-host reportedly expressed gratitude to Iger for allowing her and her co-hosts to continue doing the show in a politically divisive time. The Disney boss told Navarro he supports the show, but added that it needs to relax with its political commentary.
Multiple sources told The New York Post in February that ""The View"" executive producer Brian Teta had asked the hosts to try ""going easy"" on Trump in the weeks leading up to his inauguration.
The request was reportedly the cause of morale being ""low"" on set at the time.
One of The Daily Beast's sources noted that ABC will ""constantly have conversations with talent based on viewer feedback,"" noting that this latest instance with Iger and Karamehmedovic is ""no different.""
A spokesperson for ABC News declined to comment for this story. Representatives from Disney did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

That means someone — the company didn't say who — made a change that 'directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,' which 'violated xAI's internal policies and core values,' the company said.",

Washington — Elon Musk said Tuesday that he plans to significantly scale back his political spending, adding that he does ""not currently see a reason"" to invest his money in politics.
In a video appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum, the world's richest man was asked if he'd continue to spend at such a high level in future elections, after contributing at least $277 million to Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 cycle.
""I think in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" Elon Musk responded.
""And why is that?"" the interviewer asked.
""I think I've done enough,"" Musk said, to some laughs from the audience. But he did not entirely rule out spending on political campaigns and causes.
""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason.""
Musk, tasked by President Trump to informally oversee the Department of Government Efficiency, has come under intense scrutiny for his leadership in the chaotic government cuts. And one of his companies, Tesla, has suffered in the time he was away — in the first quarter of the year, the company's net income plummeted 71%.
Musk said on a call last month to discuss the company's earnings that he planned to scale back his time spent on DOGE. Musk has not been physically present at the White House as frequently since the end of April.
But the billionaire has also seen some benefits for his other companies. Musk accompanied Mr. Trump on the president's trip to the Middle East last week and announced his satellite company Starlink has been approved for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.",

politics,'The View' insider sounds alarm as Disney boss urges hosts to cool off political chatter,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/theviewbobiger.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-insider-sounds-alarm-disney-boss-urges-abc-daytime-hosts-cool-political-chatter,"There seems to be a clash of views within the ABC daytime talk show ""The View"" over the hyper-political coverage it has become known for.
The Daily Beast reported about an apparent rift between the ladies of ""The View"" and the top brass at the company, going all the way up to Disney CEO Bob Iger, about a desire for the hosts to cool off the politics.
Notably, all six of the co-hosts (Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro) voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and are outspoken critics of President Donald Trump.
""[ABC News president Almin] Karamehmedovic convened a meeting with The View's executive producer Brian Teta and its hosts, and suggested the panel needed to broaden its conversations beyond its predominant focus on politics, two sources familiar with the meeting said,"" the Daily Beast reported Wednesday. ""Karamehmedovic highlighted episodes with celebrity guests that he said were highly rated, one source said, and encouraged them to lean into such coverage moving forward.""
According to the report, ""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro forcefully pushed back, insisting their audience want their perspectives on politics. Navarro reportedly took her message directly to Iger, who she thanked for allowing them to keep doing their jobs, though Iger ""reaffirmed that the show needed to tone down its political rhetoric"" while expressing his support for ""The View.""
""Ultimately, the women found the requests 'silly' and that 'they were just going to keep doing their thing,'"" the Daily Beast wrote.
A source with ""The View"" confirmed to Fox News Digital these discussions were had, but suggested not all the hosts are in lockstep with Navarro.
""Most hosts agree with the ABC top brass,"" the source told Fox News Digital. ""'The View' is a daytime network talk show and needs to do more than just politics and Trump bashing. This was a welcome direction for many of us.""
When asked whether ""The View"" will ultimately pivot towards less political coverage as the second Trump presidency continues, the source responded, ""It's hard to say,"" but added, ""Ignoring Bob Iger seems like a terrible decision.""
Another source familiar with the situation said such conversations with talent are normal based on viewer feedback, and that this conversation in particular is about finding a ""balance"" in topics and reevaluating politics in general, not just stories pertaining to Trump.
Despite the internal discussions, ""The View"" has maintained its critical coverage of Trump and his administration in recent weeks.
A spokesperson for ABC News declined to comment.
Iger's request for a shift in ""The View"" did not occur in a vacuum. Trump, known for his feuds with the media, is currently in mediation with Paramount Global to resolve his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over the handling of its ""60 Minutes"" election interview with Harris.
ABC News itself settled a lawsuit filed by Trump in December, shelling out $15 million for his presidential library and an apology over liberal anchor George Stephanopoulos' false assertions that Trump was found ""liable for rape,"" alluding to the civil case victory by accuser E. Jean Carroll, when a jury actually determined Trump was liable for ""sexual abuse."" That settlement was personally approved by Iger according to reports.
Trump also landed multimillion-dollar settlements from social media giants Meta and X over their past suppression of his accounts on their platforms and is currently suing board members of the Pulitzer Prize for awarding The New York Times and The Washington Post for their Russiagate coverage.",

politics,"Elections, Gaza, polarisation drive political crime to record high in Germany",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VPQG2EP74JP2LLYU36C57YODEI.jpg?auth=560a9c78d2028767f329f689720d5666785eb4d33cfc269334fcaa0e5a69c15c&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/world/elections-gaza-polarisation-drive-political-crime-record-high-germany-2025-05-20,"BERLIN, May 20 (Reuters) - A series of closely fought elections, the war in Gaza and deepening political polarisation helped drive the number of politically motivated crimes in Germany to a record high last year, with an especially sharp growth in far-right violence.
The number of such offences recorded by police surged 40.2% to 84,172 in 2024, a report published on Tuesday by the Interior Ministry showed, a record since such data began to be collected in 2001. The number of violent political crimes rose 15% to 4,107, the highest level since 2016.
""Last year we saw a massive expansion of politically motivated crime coming from the right,"" conservative Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told a news conference at which the figures were announced.
""Forty-five percent of the victims of politically motivated violence were injured by right-wing perpetrators,"" he said.
He gave the example of assaults on gay pride parades by organised groups of far-right young people last summer.
Elsewhere, police recorded increased numbers of attacks on migrants, especially after several high-profile car-ramming and stabbing attacks on public events by immigrants, some of them asylum seekers.
There have also been increases in politically motivated crimes by the far left though such offences were far less likely to be violent, the data indicated.
Like other Western countries, Germany has been afflicted by tensions resulting from the rise of the populist far right, economic uncertainty and growing anger, especially among immigrant communities, at the government's support for Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The far-right Alternative for Germany scored its best-ever results in five elections - three regional, one national and one European - in 2024, calling for tighter immigration controls and even a departure from the European Union.
The nativist party was earlier this month officially classified as ""right-extremist"" by Germany's security services, which listed cases of its politicians dismissing naturalised immigrants as ""passport Germans"" and implying that immigrants from Muslim countries were more likely to be criminals.
But Dobrindt said he saw no reason to ban the AfD, a move some politicians have advocated. The AfD, now the second largest party in parliament, has denied posing a threat to democracy, says it opposes violence and has brought a legal challenge against authorities' characterisation of it as extremist.
""To ban a party we have to have evidence of an attack on the rule of law and democracy,"" Dobrindt said, ""and the security services' recent assessment doesn't sufficiently demonstrate that.""",
politics,Exclusive: Hungarian official sought information on perceived Orban opponents in USAID meeting,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KM5GFYTCHFNSZKU2YLURVN32GY.jpg?auth=52b7dc1367542429c4b3d2a4d36e083b92c03f313bc76e74250c57ada435827c&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-official-sought-information-perceived-orban-opponents-usaid-meeting-2025-05-16,"WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - An official appointed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to investigate foreign political interference met with Trump administration officials this week in what U.S. officials saw as a bid to enlist their help against Orban's perceived enemies in advance of elections expected next year.
A Hungarian delegation met at the headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington with Trump appointees on Thursday and requested information on the agency's partners and employees in Hungary, said a source familiar with the matter.
The meeting raised concerns among some U.S. officials that information the Hungarians were seeking on U.S. funding for groups in Hungary would be used to bolster Orban's crackdown on independent media and civil society groups and they declined to provide it, the source said.
The Hungarian delegation was led by Andras Laszlo, a member of the European Parliament for Orban's ruling Fidesz party who was appointed in February as a commissioner to investigate alleged foreign interference. He told Reuters on Friday that some organizations in Hungary funded by USAID were ""very much of a political nature and have a high impact on Hungarian political life.""
USAID under past administrations supported civil society and media in countries around the world in the name of building resilient democracies, but critics including Orban say the goal was to overthrow governments not aligned with the United States.
The U.S. Department of State confirmed the meeting between Laszlo and officials including Kenneth Jackson, USAID Deputy Administrator for Management and Resources, saying that it was arranged at the request of the Hungarian official.
Orban has pledged to crack down on foreign funding of media and civil society groups in what his critics say is a move to strengthen his position ahead of 2026 elections, when he will face an unprecedented challenge from a new opposition party.
He has touted his personal friendship with U.S. President Donald Trump, with the two sharing a similar approach to issues including immigration, transgender rights and Russia's war in Ukraine.
Fidesz submitted a bill on Tuesday that would allow a government office to draw up a list of organizations that get foreign funding and would restrict or even shut them down if the government decides they threaten Hungary and its culture.
Critics have compared the proposed law, which would impose huge fines on organizations that accept foreign funds, to Russian legislation that allows authorities to label foreign-funded groups and others engaged in political activities as foreign agents.
Laszlo said he was tasked with sharing information with Washington on what he called foreign interference around Hungary's last general election in 2022. That involved asking Trump administration officials to share information with Hungary on the ""extent... and the intent"" of U.S. funding to organizations working in Hungary, he said, declining to detail the discussions further.
Laszlo said his investigation and his party's proposed law were not aimed at their opponents but at ridding Hungarian politics of foreign influence.
At Thursday's meeting, the U.S. officials politely refused to provide the information requested and closed the meeting by suggesting that Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto contact U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to arrange formal talks, according to the source familiar with the matter.
Laszlo said the discussions were private, but acknowledged what he called ""uncertainty and hesitancy"" among U.S. officials.
Key figures in Trump's MAGA movement - including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and conservative media personality Tucker Carlson - draw inspiration from Orban and his self-declared ""illiberal democracy."" Orban's opponents have called him an authoritarian.
Tamas Matura, a non-resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Laszlo's trip appeared to be part of a crackdown by Fidesz and Orban on perceived opponents, including independent media, that is expected to intensify in the run-up to the 2026 elections.
'I think they need every kind of tool and method to start a smear campaign against any kind of opposition,' he said.
Laszlo said in the interview at the Hungarian embassy in Washington that the information he was seeking would not be used to prosecute organizations for receiving funding in the past.
""This wouldn't be about punishment. This would be about understanding and developing prevention based on better and better understanding of what happened previously,"" he said.
Laszlo said he wanted to know if money distributed through USAID's Central Europe Program was ""misused for political purposes and political activism.""
That program began in 2022 and provided $35 million to ""promote democratic institutions and resilience of independent, non-governmental entities"" in countries including Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
Laszlo in March met with Pete Marocco, who oversaw the administration's early efforts to shut down USAID's operations.
Trump's administration has moved to fire nearly all USAID staff, as billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has slashed funding and dismissed contractors across the federal bureaucracy in what it calls an attack on wasteful spending.",

But he might be ready to give up the title.
Mr. Musk, the world's richest person, said on Tuesday that he was planning to spend 'a lot less' in future elections, the latest sign that he is fading into the background of American politics — at least for now.
'In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,' Mr. Musk said as he appeared virtually for a combative interview with Bloomberg News at the Qatar Economic Forum. 'I think I've done enough.'
He did keep the door open, however. Asked if his decision stemmed from any blowback he had faced for helping to guide the Trump administration, he said: 'If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it. But I don't currently see a reason.'
Mr. Musk disclosed over $290 million in federal spending on the 2024 election cycle, most of which went toward backing Donald J. Trump through a super PAC that he started. He has told Mr. Trump's advisers that he planned to donate about $100 million to pro-Trump groups before the 2026 midterm elections.
In the months after Mr. Trump took office in January, Mr. Musk became a frequent presence in Washington as he steered an ambitious, controversial effort to sharply cut government spending. He has also remained a powerful player in Republican campaign finance. Along with an allied group, he spent roughly $25 million on a major Wisconsin Supreme Court race to back a conservative candidate who lost badly.
Lately, Mr. Musk has indicated a desire to turn back to his business empire. After a sharp drop in profit at his electric-car company, Tesla, he told Wall Street analysts last month that he planned to spend less time in Washington and more on his companies.
He did say on Tuesday, however, that he planned to be in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday, including for a dinner with Mr. Trump.",

Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the South Asian nation of 173 million last August after a student-led uprising forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.
Nahid Islam, the head of the newly-formed National Citizen Party (NCP), which wants national elections held only after the completion of reforms, said Yunus was finding it difficult to work without the backing of political parties.
""He was visibly upset,"" Islam told reporters after meeting the leader on Thursday.
""He said if he cannot do the work he was asked to do - reform the system and prepare for fair elections - then he may have to leave. He feels trapped between demands from different political camps and growing public impatience.""
Yunus promised major reforms in various sectors after Hasina's exit, but a lack of progress and growing political disagreement have put his administration in a tight spot.
""We told him clearly that people didn't rise up just to switch governments, but to change the system,"" said Islam, whose party emerged from last year's student-led protests. ""Elections without reform will only take us back to the same problems.""
He gave no further details.
Yunus' press wing did not immediately respond to telephone calls and messages seeking comment.
With the interim government caught between competing demands for swift general elections and reforms, such a resignation could lead to further uncertainty. Yunus has said the elections could be delayed until 2026.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been pushing for polls by December. On Wednesday, BNP leaders said it would be ""difficult"" to continue supporting the interim government without a firm election plan.
Responding to Islam's remarks, senior BNP leader Abdul Moyeen Khan called for official corroboration from Yunus' office, at a time when his government's credibility was at its lowest ebb.
""I would rather say, the holy wish of the people of Bangladesh is a dignified exit of Dr Yunus (and his) also honouring the trust put by our people on him for organising a free and fair election at the earliest,"" he added.
Adding to the pressure, Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, also called for elections in December in a speech at Dhaka cantonment this week, expressing his dissatisfaction over the political situation.
Last September, Zaman told Reuters in an interview that elections could be held within the next 18 months.
The registration of Hasina's Awami League party was suspended this month, effectively barring the party from contesting the next elections.",

Published May 16, 2025
Former Minnesota Vikings and University of Minnesota football player Jack Brewer shared a grievance with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.
The AG is waging a legal battle against President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice to ensure transgender athletes can continue participating in girls sports in the state. The state's ongoing defiance of Trump's executive order to keep girls sports female has resulted in a controversy involving a transgender pitcher who has dominated a girls softball season.
""Clearly, Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, has never played any major sports,"" Brewer told Fox News Digital.
""It's like he's never stepped foot in a real locker room, especially not one where the sport demanded true athleticism, grit and toughness. It's embarrassing to watch a Black man stand before the nation and promote boys competing against girls.""

The White House has responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion.
""Why would a grown man sue the Trump administration to allow other biological males to participate in women's sports? This is creepy and anti-woman,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital.
Brewer played four seasons for the Golden Gophers from 1998-2001, then started his NFL career with the Vikings in 2002. He also raised his children in the state.
HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE
""The state has veered so far off course that it's doing the exact opposite of what it once stood for. It used to be a national leader on Title IX and women's rights. Now, it's destroying women's sports, degrading women and promoting situations where men are physically dominating women,"" Brewer said.
""It's heartbreaking for any former Gopher, any former Viking, any professional athlete who's lived in that great city. It's embarrassing. It's shocking. And, to be honest, it's just devastating.""
Reports of a trans softball pitcher winning 14 straight games heading into the playoffs and earning first-team All-State honors rocked the state in recent weeks.
For Brewer, it is a difficult situation to witness as a Minnesota resident and former pro athlete.
""In any sport — especially something like softball — people can get seriously hurt. A man hits the ball harder. A man throws the ball faster. So, the idea of allowing men to compete in women's softball — especially now, when that sport has grown in visibility and opportunity — is insane,"" Brewer said.
""Women's softball is one of the fastest-growing sports in America. If every high school varsity baseball player decided to go play Division I women's softball, there would be no women left on the field. Anyone who supports that agenda is either ignorant or pushing politics over people.
""And that's exactly what Keith Ellison is doing. They don't care about the girls. They care about fundraising and staying in power, and they're doing it at the expense of young athletes all across America.
""President Trump understands exactly what's happening. He said it best. If you put a bunch of MLB players on a women's softball team, they'd win the championship.""
Ellison made the announcement of the lawsuit at a press conference after months of the state defying Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order . Ellison claimed he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order.
""I'm not going to sit around waiting for the Trump administration to sue Minnesota. Today, Minnesota is suing him and his administration because we will not participate in this shameful bullying,"" Ellison said. ""We will not let a small group of vulnerable children who are only trying be healthy and live their lives be demonized.""

Ellison's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, argues the Trump administration does not have the authority to set states' athletic gender eligibility policies through an executive order.
Minnesota is the first state to sue the Department of Justice over threats of funding cuts for allowing trans athletes to play in girls sports and the second state to sue the Trump administration over the issue.
Maine filed a lawsuit against Trump after the Department of Agriculture cut funding to the state April 2, and a federal judge has already ruled the USDA must release the funding to Maine.
After Trump's executive order, the Minnesota State High School League announced it would defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports.
Ellison's office said ""based on the plain language of the statute, educational institutions and the Minnesota State High School League would violate the MHRA by prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in extracurricular activities consistent with their gender identity.""
Minnesota's state legislature failed to pass the Preserving Girls' Sports Act in early March, which would have stated that ""only female students may participate in an elementary or secondary school level athletic team or sport that an educational institution has restricted to women and girls.""
A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports.
Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

The religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the activist group Female Athletes United and three anonymous girls softball players in the state over the ongoing controversy.
""Minnesota is failing its female athletes. The state is putting the rights of males ahead of females, telling girls their hard work may never be enough to win and that they don't deserve fairness and safety,"" Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Suzanne Beecher told Fox News Digital.
""By sacrificing protection for female athletes, Minnesota fails to offer girls equal treatment and opportunity, violating Title IX's provisions. Our client, Female Athletes United, is right to stand up for its members by challenging the state's discriminatory policy and advocate for true equality in sports.""
The defendants are Ellison, the Minnesota State High School League Executive Director Erich Martens, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero and Minnesota Commissioner of Education Willie Jett.
Ellison's office has released a statement responding to the lawsuit.
""In addition to getting exercise and the fun of competition, playing sports comes with so many benefits for young people. You build friendships that can last a lifetime, you learn how to work as part of a team, and you get to feel like you belong,"" Ellison said.
""I believe it is wrong to single out one group of students, who already face higher levels of bullying and harassment, and tell these kids they cannot be on the team because of who they are. I will continue to defend the rights of all students to play sports with their friends and peers.""
Reports of the trans softball pitcher winning 14 straight games heading into the playoffs and earning first-team All-State honors rocked the state in recent weeks.
Former Vikings player Jack Brewer even spoke out about the controversy rocking his state's high school sports scene.
""In any sport — especially something like softball — people can get seriously hurt. A man hits the ball harder. A man throws the ball faster. So, the idea of allowing men to compete in women's softball — especially now, when that sport has grown in visibility and opportunity — is insane,"" Brewer told Fox News Digital.
Meanwhile, Ellison is suing President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice to ensure transgender athletes can continue participating in girls sports in the state.
After Trump signed the ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order, the Minnesota State High School League announced it would defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports.
Ellison then claimed at a press conference on April 22 that he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order, so the AG decided to sue first.
""I'm not going to sit around waiting for the Trump administration to sue Minnesota.

During an interview with Joe Rogan, Rodgers made his stance on the issue clear, calling the transgender movement ""anti-woman.""
""The trans woman movement is actually anti-woman,"" Rodgers told ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""
Rodgers then clarified the belief applies mainly in sports.
""That's what I mean — sports. You're not seeing trans men dominating anything. It's because there's a biological difference.""
Rodgers is an unsigned free agent after departing the New York Jets after two seasons. The 41-year-old former MVP has been a lightning rod of controversy in the media for expressing conservative opinions during podcast appearances the last four years.
The quarterback was invited to become the running mate of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during Kennedy's independent presidential campaign in 2024.
Now, Rodgers joins fellow former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre and wide receiver Donald Driver in taking a vocal stance against allowing trans athletes to compete in women's sports. Favre has been outspoken about the topic since 2021.
Rodgers spoke out at a critical time in the ongoing debate over the issue. President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating that institutions across the country allow only biological females to compete in women's and girls athletics.
However, many Democrat-run states have openly defied Trump's order, prompting both internal and federal backlash. The U.S. Department of Education is investigating multiple states' high school sports leagues for potential Title IX violations, and the Department of Justice is engaged in legal battles with Maine and Minnesota over the issue.
A January New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports.
""Thinking about transgender female athletes — meaning athletes who were male at birth but who currently identify as female — do you think they should or should not be allowed to compete in women's sports?"" the survey asked.
Of the 2,128 respondents who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports.
Of the 1,025 respondents who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.
Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%.

By Tommy Tuberville
Published May 21, 2025
As a former college football coach for 40 years, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of college sports in shaping young lives. From the locker room to the classroom, athletics instill discipline, teamwork and resilience — values that extend far beyond the field. But ever since the Supreme Court ruled that college athletes can be compensated for the use of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL), college sports have been in a tailspin.
While I'm all for players making money, we need to create national standards to protect the integrity of college sports. Because there are no national rules for NIL contracts, every state has passed its own laws. This patchwork of laws has created an uneven playing field and given some universities advantages over their competitors.
We now have pay-to-play as bidding wars for recruits are starting in middle and high school. This is not to mention the transfer portal, which has become a revolving door with student-athletes jumping from school to school in pursuit of more money.
TRUMP CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REGULATE NIL AFTER MEETING WITH NICK SABAN: REPORT
For example, the men's basketball teams at Kentucky, Duke and the University of North Carolina are preparing for their entire rosters to change in the upcoming 2025-26 season. This is not only bad for team culture, it's also having negative impacts on the student-athletes' educations, which is what college athletics is supposed to be all about.
I've been working to try to address these issues since I got to the Senate in 2021. Last Congress, West Virginia Independent Senator Joe Manchin and I introduced the ""Protecting Athletes, Schools, and Sports Act"" (PASS Act). This bipartisan legislation would establish a national standard for NIL contracts, ensuring consistency and fairness across all institutions.
The PASS Act would also require universities to honor the original scholarship made to student-athletes, regardless of their NIL deal status, and provide stability by moderating eligibility for the transfer portal.

Importantly, this was not just our bill — we worked with student athletes, coaches, athletics directors and parents to draft it. Unfortunately, Democrats, who had the majority at the time, refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.
SEN TUBERVILLE PREVIEWS NIL MEETING WITH TRUMP, SAYS DEMOCRATS 'DON'T CARE' ABOUT COLLEGE SPORTS
Thankfully, President Donald Trump — a notorious sports fan — is looking to get involved. A few weeks ago, I had the chance to talk to him about our fight to preserve college sports while on Air Force One headed to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was particularly focused on protecting women's and Olympic sports, which are sadly in danger of being eliminated at some schools who don't have enough money to play players.
He was also focused on preserving education, ensuring antitrust protections are in place, and protecting women's and Olympic sports, which are sadly being eliminated at some schools that don't have enough money to pay players. In typical Trump fashion, he sprang into action.
Following our conversation, the White House began exploring ways, ranging from an executive order to a federal commission, to address the most pressing issues within college athletics. By hearing from key stakeholders, including my friends former Coach Nick Saban from Alabama and former NFL player and Chairman of the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System Cody Campbell, the Trump administration is working to gather possible solutions that address the complexities of NIL and its impact on college sports.

Regardless of which path Trump chooses to address the current state of college sports, I'm confident that his administration — which has already proven to be both effective and unafraid to shake up the status quo — can make meaningful reforms to make sure college sports remain intact.
NCAA POWER FOUR COMMISSIONERS SAY THEY 'NEED HELP FROM CONGRESS' TO REGULATE NIL, TRANSFER PORTAL
Meanwhile, I'll continue to work with my colleagues to hopefully draft legislation that could pass both chambers. The challenges facing college sports today are formidable, but not insurmountable. With President Trump's leadership and a unified approach, we can navigate this new era while preserving the integrity and spirit of collegiate athletics.

sports,Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian talks to CNN about investment into Chelsea Women and women's sports,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2215744973.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/22/sport/alexis-ohanian-chelsea-womens-investment-intl-spt,"When entrepreneur and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian started to think about investing in women's soccer, opposition to the idea came from an unlikely source: His wife, tennis legend Serena Williams.
'When I first told Serena I was gonna buy or start a women's soccer team here in the States, she actually tried to talk me out of it, because I think she had been so exposed to the infrastructure around women's sports,' Ohanian explained to CNN Sports.
'Because of her lived experience, she actually was trying to talk me out of it because she had to kick down a lot of doors.'
Ohanian, who this month purchased a minority stake in England's Chelsea FC Women, explained that such close proximity to the 23-time grand slam singles champion and her sister, Venus, showed 'proof of the business viability of women's professional sports.'
Ohanian was the founding investor of Angel City FC, a Los Angeles-based team that began playing in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2022 – the top division of the women's game in the US. The club then became the most valuable women's professional sports team in the world after a huge takeover agreement in 2024.
Ohanian, whose investment in Chelsea is reported by British media to be worth more than $26 million for a 10% share of the club, is just one of many putting cash into women's sports.
His investment announcement comes in the same month as the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty reportedly raised capital from investors at $450 million in what is thought to be a record valuation for a professional women's sports franchise, according to The Athletic, who cited sources familiar with the deal.
Meanwhile, Ohanian's wife, Serena, is a minority owner of Angel City and Tiger Woods' and Rory McIlroy's innovative golf league the TGL, the Miami Dolphins – along with sister Venus – and in March, announced her ownership role in the expansion Canadian WNBA franchise, the Toronto Tempo.
Ohanian said that he saw the reluctance of others to invest in women's soccer as an opportunity.
'When experts in a space try to talk me out of it, that's actually when I tend to lean in more because it tells me that sort of dissent or that pushback is usually where there's a tremendous opportunity for innovation and progress,' he said.
The 42-year-old Ohanian announced the deal to invest in Chelsea Women earlier in May, saying he was 'proud' to help the 'iconic club' – already one of the most successful teams in women's soccer – become the most popular Women's Super League (WSL) team in the US.
'I think a lot of well-intentioned people historically have supported women's sports in a way that … actually held it back because it was viewed too much as charity, or they led with things like, 'Oh, I'm doing this because I have a daughter,'' he told CNN. 'No, I'm doing this because I think these are tremendous athletes.'
He added that sports and incredible athletes are going to thrive in a time of growing use of artificial intelligence because 'the types of entertainment that are going to endure are the ones that are fundamentally human.'
In 2024, Ohanian founded Athlos, a women's-only track and field event that debuted later that year. The event offers $60,000 for race winners and aims to champion female athletes across the world.
'One of the north stars for me five years ago – when I started on this journey of building, investing in and around women's professional sports – has been: This investment isn't just in the clubs, it's in the surrounding infrastructure that's gonna flow through every level of women's sports.
'For 100 years, professional sports has been by men for men. And when there have been women and women's teams, in many ways, they've been literally treated as just small men, which is pretty ridiculous, right?' he explained to CNN Sports.
Ohanian said that teams like Chelsea, who this month secured a sixth consecutive WSL title, a domestic treble and remained unbeaten for 22 consecutive games, offer 'a chance to show folks something really, really special.'
'I'm glad the discourse has now shifted where people are realizing there's real opportunity here, but there's still so much more work to be done, and I really believe that this club could and should be the first billion dollar franchise, billion dollar club in women's sports.'

Earlier this month, Urlacher appeared on the ""Global View"" podcast and wondered why it is even a debate. On Wednesday's edition of ""America Reports,"" he said it is ""common sense.""
""Athletically, it's just not fair. You know, men are meant to play with men,"" Urlacher said. ""That's why there's the NBA and the WNBA or LPGA and PGA Tour. They're different. I just don't understand how people think it's OK for a male to participate in a woman's sport.
""There are just so many biological differences. You have the guy that was swimming with the women there from Penn a couple years ago with Riley Gaines and some of her teammates, and you saw how he was with the men compared to with the women. It's just not fair. It's pretty obvious to most people.""
Urlacher also questioned why other girls and women are not speaking out but pointed out that doing so has hurt them.
""You see these girls stand up, and it's really hurting themselves when they stand up because they're not competing because they don't want to compete against a man. So, they're stepping down from their competitions,"" he added.
""And it's kind of funny coming from people who push women's rights, and they want to fight for women's rights, but they don't wanna fight for women's rights in sports. They want men to come in there and dominate the sports against the women. It's just, it's not fair. It's common sense. I think we've seen President Trump talk about it since he's been elected. It's pretty much common sense just to not have men in women's sports.
""It's just not fair. You know, I saw a track athlete in South Carolina a couple of years ago doing the same thing, just winning every event. There's biological differences. Men should not be competing against women. It's not fair. It's dangerous. You saw the volleyball player, the man spiking the ball, hitting the woman in the face.
""It's … not fair and it can be really dangerous. It's funny what Aaron [Rodgers] said. You don't see women try competing against men in our sports. You don't see them trying to play football. You don't see them try and do things that they wouldn't be as good at or could get hurt at.""
Illinois, where Urlacher spent his NFL career, has become a hotbed of controversy over the issue of trans athlete inclusion in recent days after a biological male competed in a seventh-grade track meet against biological females at the Naper Prairie Conference Meet.
Several other states have defied President Donald Trump's executive order on the issue, resulting in Maine temporarily losing federal funding.

Disney filed a lawsuit against YouTube in a state court in Los Angeles late Wednesday to stop the appointment, alleging breach of contract, unfair competition and interference with a contractual relationship.
Disney claimed that YouTube is and has been aware of Connolly's employment agreement, which required him to work for Disney through at least March 1, 2027. He signed a new three-year contract in November 2024 that gave him a one-time right to terminate it until March 2027.
It seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Connolly from further breaching the contract.
YouTube did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Connolly will manage the platform's relationships with major media companies as well as take charge of the company's growing live-sports portfolio, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The popular video sharing platform has been aggressively pursuing live sports for the past few years, alongside competitors such as Netflix and Amazon, in a bid to take advantage of its massive user base and large sports audience.
YouTube inked a $14 billion NFL streaming deal in 2022, which enables it to stream big football matches, while Amazon and other media firms also rushed to secure big sports streaming deals.
The platform has also expanded beyond traditional video sharing and into live TV, music and podcasts, and generates billions in advertising revenue from its vast content reserves.
Connolly spent over two decades at ESPN and Disney and exited his role as head of platform distribution earlier this week as Disney gears up to launch its ESPN sports streaming platform.",

GGBET UA also presented a museum exhibition to visitors, featuring unique trophies won by Ukrainian esports teams, as well as important facts about the history of esports' development within Ukraine.
SBC Summit Ukraine is the third all-Ukrainian sports marketing conference and brings together sports and business to create new projects. GGBET UA is once again a premium sponsor of the event. The Ukraine in esports: facts and fakes panel discussion was the first forum for professional dialog involving experts from this industry in the history of SBC Summit Ukraine. They discussed three common assumptions many people have about esports: that 'esports is not a serious industry,' 'esports in Ukraine can never be as popular as traditional sports,' and 'it's easier to succeed in esports than in traditional sports.'
During the discussion, the speakers shared interesting facts and insights about their niche. Yevhen Zolotarov, CEO of Ukraine's most successful club, NAVI, said that esports clubs currently have balanced business models and more formats for monetization than traditional sports (e.g., digital items), which creates additional possibilities for partners and sponsors. Vitalii ""v1lat"" Volachai, legendary commentator and co-founder of Maincast, shared his opinion that NAVI's match in the final of the CS2 World Championship in 2024 was one of the top three most-watched sports events, behind two football matches featuring Shakhtar and Dinamo. Viktor Proniakin, head of product at Esports Charts' analytics service highlighted the fact that when it comes to qualifier matches, esports is already beating traditional sports — an average event could draw in 30-50 thousand views from a Ukrainian-language audience.
Andriy Hryshchenko, Executive Director of the Ukrainian Esports Federation, spoke about an important topic: socializing and reintegrating soldiers through esports. The federation already dedicates time to working with veterans and soldiers in active service and is developing ideas offered by soldiers and finding great potential in them.
'We have collected assumptions about esports that are widely held, but controversial. This enabled us to facilitate a lively and open discussion. For a long time, esports has had its fans, its system of tournaments, its structure and partnerships, and disciplines such as CS2 and Dota 2, which are now included in the top 10 sports on GGBET UA. This industry unites generations, and we are delighted that we could demonstrate its true scale to SBC Summit Ukraine participants,' stated Sergii Mishchenko, CEO of GGBET UA.
GGBET UA also presented a museum of esports, at which visitors could check out original trophies won by Ukrainian teams from global tournaments, find out about the history of Ukraine's esports scene, and be persuaded that esports is an important component of modern sporting culture.
SBC Summit Ukraine 2025 also saw a raffle held of two CS:GO record books — an exclusive publication detailing world records in this cult game created by GGBET in collaboration with global publishers Dot Esports.

""Just excited. This is actually our first WNBA game,"" said fan Anna Williams. ""This is the only home team we pay attention to besides the Dallas Stars. I have learned the whole roster and everything.""
Paige Bueckers boosts Wings' profile
ARLINGTON, TEXAS - MAY 16: Paige Bueckers #5 of the Dallas Wings attempts a free-throw against the Minnesota Lynx during the second half at College Park Center on May 16, 2025 in Arlington, Texas.

Much of the excitement centered on the Wings' new star player, Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 overall draft pick who joined the team in April. The addition of Bueckers has put the franchise in the spotlight more than ever in its 10-year history, said Wings Chief Operating Officer Lauryn Turner.
""I think one of the most amazing stats is we sold merchandise in all 50 states and 23 countries,"" Turner said. ""It's such an exciting time for all women in sports, but especially in women's basketball.""
Fan travels from Boston for game
Among those who traveled long distances to see Bueckers play was Coral Sequin, who flew from Boston to Dallas just for the game.
""I came in from Boston yesterday at 10 a.m. to come see this game,"" Sequin said. She even purchased a cowboy hat personalized with Bueckers' initials and jersey number.
Sequin shared her thoughts on whether the WNBA is experiencing a resurgence, saying that people are starting to see women's sports as simply sports, deserving of the same attention and recognition.
""I think people are realizing now women's sports — it's just sports, too,"" Sequin said. ""It's not women's sports, it's sports, and it deserves the attention.""
Young fan finds inspiration in game
For 8-year-old Lilly, Friday's matchup was her first WNBA game. Her father said he hoped the experience would inspire her to pursue her passions.
""It means a lot. It gives her something to look forward to, someone to look up to,"" he said. ""It gives them a reason to try to get further in life, doing the sports they love as well.""
Though the Wings lost 99-84 to the Minnesota Lynx, fans said the sold-out game was a promising sign for the team and its future.",
sports,Chip Ganassi: Team Penske needs to be held to 'higher standard to protect the sport',https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/05/penkse1.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chip-ganassi-penske-penalties,"On Sunday, during the second day of qualifying for the 109th running of ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,"" it was discovered that the cars of Team Penske's Josef Newgarden and Will Power had an illegally modified part.
They were disqualified from making a four-lap run, and INDYCAR a day later hammered the team: Newgarden, the two-time defending race winner, was dropped to 32nd in the field and Power was moved to last for this weekend's Indy 500.
Chip Ganassi, the CEO of Chip Ganassi Racing, was one of many who complained to INDYCAR inspectors and Penske executives that the cars were illegal on Sunday. The next day, he remained disappointed in the drama that is now overshadowing the biggest race in the world, one that is sold out for the first time since 2016.
""I think all teams have a certain responsibility to uphold the integrity of the sport, in any series, and no team more than team Penske,"" Ganassi said on an episode of ""Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour"" set to be released Thursday.
""They've had so much success over the years, and it's a team that everybody has heard of, and they have success around the world in a lot of different series, so they need to be held to a higher standard to protect the sport, especially with the investment that Roger Penske has at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in the INDYCAR Series and his business, for that matter,"" Ganassi added.
Newgarden is attempting to become the first driver to win the Indy 500 in three consecutive years, but no driver has won after starting on the last row. Power, meanwhile, is in a contract year and Team Penske has maintained it wouldn't begin discussions on an extension until after the 500. Asked last week about Power's future with the team, Cindric told AP: ""Well, if he wins the 500, that would make for a much easier conversation.""
Now, Newgarden and Power are in deep holes despite having nothing to do with the situation.
""They have a responsibility to protect the sport — we all do,"" Ganassi told Harvick. ""Everyone that's in it needs to protect the sport, and it's certainly a problem when the pursuit of winning compromises the integrity and sportsmanship. That's what you have.""

But step inside and it is a hidden treasure trove.
A glass cabinet to the right contains footballs signed by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes.
A Sporting CP shirt with Ronaldo's signature adorns the wall, hung among signed cycling and rugby jerseys.

And just opposite the cashier is a caricature of each member of the 2023-24 Primeira Liga-winning Sporting squad. On the bottom row, in the centre, a face with an infectious smile: their former head coach Ruben Amorim.
On a night when Amorim, now head coach of Manchester United, is 900km away in Bilbao for the Europa League final, every table in the restaurant is reserved for Sporting and Benfica fans, gathered to watch as United take on Tottenham Hotspur.
The Athletic takes a seat alongside them, as the local hero faces one of the hardest nights of his football life.
When Amorim left Sporting for United in November, 23-year-old Joao Rodrigues was 'heartbroken'.
'It was the most painful feeling in my life — worse than when I broke up with my first girlfriend,' he tells The Athletic, minutes before the final starts. The dagger to the heart was Amorim leaving mid-season, despite having said he would stay until the end.
The fans The Athletic spoke to were sad that Amorim left, perhaps bitter for a few days, but also grateful. They loved Amorim and still do. He was the 'greatest manager in Sporting's history' who 'changed the club's status', according to Rodrigues. Despite the perceived betrayal, he says will always root for the Portuguese head coach, hence he is supporting United in the final.
Sporting and Benfica supporters are too caught up in their own rivalry to be truly invested in United's defining game of the season — Sporting won the league last Sunday with new coach Rui Borges and will face Benfica in the final of the Taca de Portugal this Sunday — but the fans in the restaurant are drawn to United given Amorim is in charge, and by the club's Portuguese link, including Ronaldo, Jose Mourinho, Fernandes, Nani and Diogo Dalot.
Although Amorim has not yet managed Benfica, it was his boyhood club and he played for them for six seasons. Benfica fans Goncalo Silva and Pedro Almeida were happy when Amorim left Sporting, as they felt it would benefit their team, and it seems they would not mind if United lost the final as Benfica fans still dream Amorim will come back to manage his boyhood club one day.
The thought of that is 'our nightmare,' chips in Joao Caetano Costa, another Sporting fan. 'A tough pill to swallow!' says his colleague Francisco Rodrigues, as they enjoy after-work drinks.
Fernando Santos, the 2016 European Championship-winning manager with Portugal, and Fulham head coach Marco Silva sometimes pop in to A Tasquinha Do Lagarto for lunch. The restaurant's co-owner, Ricardo Rodrigues, has become used to famous patrons and once took a call here from the United captain. His view of the final is that Amorim 'has a lucky star'.

'He wins against all odds,' he says. 'I think he's going to win because Tottenham don't win any titles. It's a historic fact.'
At the beginning of the first half, Rodrigues weaves in and out of tables taking orders. Soon, local dishes of cod and octopus are served. The atmosphere is far from tense, a convivial evening among friends who are curious about their former head coach's fortunes. An eerie silence, however, cuts through the chatter when Brennan Johnson puts Spurs 1-0 up with a scrappy goal in the 42nd minute.
At half-time, Rodrigues puffs his cheeks before quickly returning to the kitchen. Another fan says: 'It's tough but you have to still believe'.
Leny Yoro's chance in the 57th minute momentarily distracts customers from their steak, eggs, rice and chips while there are jeers in the 62nd minute when Spurs fail to make the most of their counter-attack.
'Eeeesh,' is the reaction to Rasmund Hojlund's header being acrobatically cleared off the line by Micky van de Ven. Another Sporting fan, Joao Costa, puts his head in his hands as Alejandro Garnacho's shot is parried wide.
'Manchester United don't have a striker,' says Costa.
With seven minutes to go, the boys tuck into their desserts, a traditional Portuguese sponge cake, fuelling themselves for extra time.
Heads drop as Yoro's shot goes way over the bar. United are pressing but cannot find a way through. Vicario saves Luke Shaw's header in the 96th minute and time is running out. The final whistle blows.
Many of those present are sad and disappointed for Amorim and United. 'Maybe he'll come here!' says Silva, the Benfica fan. Rodrigues believes the club will give Amorim more time — patience is required, just like when he first started at Sporting.
Miguel Pinheiro, another Sporting fan, is less empathetic. 'It's quite funny, in a sarcastic way, to see Ruben losing. It's good to see his losing face.'
Asked if he is bitter that Amorim left Sporting, Pinheiro replies: 'There is a soft bitterness. Even when people leave, you can still win titles (referring to Sporting's league triumph this year).
'He (Amorim) went to do something he wanted to do. He failed and we won. Funny days, right? I'm sorry to say, if it were my decision, I would sack him immediately. I'm only being rational.'
There is a magnetic pull from Portugal to United, and Amorim's move to Manchester strengthened that connection. His fans before he made that journey are as intrigued as anyone to see what his future holds.",

Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy are reaching across the aisle to roll out a measure that would quickly deliver new and effective technologies to strengthen law enforcement's ability to combat human and drug trafficking at the border, Fox News Digital has learned.
Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Cassidy, R-La., are working together to introduce the ""Emerging Innovative Border Technologies Act,"" which would make innovation teams at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) permanent. Innovation teams were first created at the agency in 2018.
The bill would authorize the CBP commissioner to maintain one or more innovation teams to research and adapt commercial technologies to assist in border security operations and urgent mission needs.
It also would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit a plan to Congress that assesses the performance parameters and security impacts of potential technologies, as well as the deactivation of former CBP technology.
""Technology continues to improve our everyday lives, and it's just common sense that we look for ways innovative technologies can help keep our border communities secure,"" Cortez Maso told Fox News Digital. ""I am committed to helping CBP continue developing the tools they need to improve border security operations.""
""President Trump secured the southern border in his first 30 days,"" Cassidy told Fox News Digital. ""Let's secure the border forever by using new technology.""
He added, ""Let's stop fentanyl from flowing into our country.""
The senators told Fox News Digital that investments in border security technology will ""strengthen CBP's detection and response time to cases of trafficking and illicit border crossings in remote areas.""
The legislation would make innovation teams a more permanent and long-lasting part of Customs and Border operations.
A Cortez Masto aide told Fox News Digital that the senator has been working to crack down on cross-border crime since she was attorney general of Nevada. The aide highlighted Cortez Masto's work with Republicans in the state, along with Mexican officials, to combat the rise of methamphetamine manufacturing and cross-border drug trafficking.
In the Senate, she has authored legislation to combat drug trafficking online, which was signed into law, and passed legislation to eliminate illegal fentanyl supply chains. Cortez Masto has also introduced a bill that would crack down on the deadly fentanyl additive xylazine.
Meanwhile, a similar version of the ""Emerging Innovative Border Technologies Act"" was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., and Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas.
Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted 93% under President Donald Trump's administration, according to new data from CBP released Monday.
CBP says it averaged 279 apprehensions per day at the southern border in April, compared to 4,297 apprehensions in April 2024. The total apprehensions for April landed at 8,383, compared to April 2024's 129,000.
CBP officials also noted that just five illegal immigrants were temporarily released into the U.S. during April, compared to 68,000 during the same month in 2024.",
technology,"Exclusive: Citi to cut up to 200 tech contractor roles in China, sources say",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2YK6PFF6FIQNOIJNOS5RA2RPA.jpg?auth=17a0c87f96e2c5d73fa1daf1a19e4aa38460a626a8a5ea261ba052b651f991fe&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citi-cut-up-200-tech-contractor-roles-china-sources-say-2025-05-16,"HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Citigroup (C.N), opens new tab is cutting up to 200 information technology (IT) contractor roles in China, two people familiar with the matter said, as the bank looks to hire its own staff globally for such operations to improve risk management and data governance.
Last July, U.S. bank regulators fined Citi $136 million for making ""insufficient progress"" fixing data management issues and the IT revamp underscores Citi's efforts to meet regulatory demands.
Around 100 IT staff in China were informed this week that their contracts will not be renewed, and another 100 are likely to receive their termination notices soon, said the people, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. The job cuts have not been reported previously.
The staff are employed by Citigroup Services and Technology China, a wholly-owned China unit Citi established in 2002, which has around 3,000 employees in total, according to the sources.
It was not immediately clear how many of those employees are contractors.
The unit supports the bank's global businesses - including investment and consumer banking - in 20 countries and regions including New York, London and Hong Kong, its website shows.
Citi's head of technology Tim Ryan told staff earlier this year that the bank aimed to reduce the share of external contractors in IT to 20% from the current 50%, according to an internal presentation to employees seen by Reuters.
At the same time, the Wall Street bank planned to hire more staff, aiming to raise technology headcount to 50,000 from 48,000 in 2024, the presentation showed.
In China, Citi is offering most of the affected contractors a severance package based on their years of service, the sources said.
""As part of the regular business operations of Citigroup Services and Technology (China) Limited (CSTC), we review our HR strategy on an ongoing basis, including decisions about renewing (fixed term) employment contracts,"" said Citi in a statement.
""When decisions are made on non-renewal of fixed term contracts, this will be done in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and procedures. We are committed to supporting impacted employees.""
Besides its IT operations, Citi has banking business in China and is in the process of setting up a securities unit there.
The cutting of IT contractor jobs in China has no impact on Citi's business strategy and commitment to both local and global clients in that market, said a spokesperson for the bank in Hong Kong.
Other global financial firms have also taken steps to reduce their dependence on China as an IT and service outsourcing destination, as costs rise, and geopolitical uncertainties and new regulations weigh.
Reuters reported in October 2024 that asset manager Fidelity International cut around 500 jobs at one of its technology and operations centres in northeastern Chinese city of Dalian.",

The proposals come one year after the tragic death of a child protective services worker in Westchester County. Maria Coto was brutally beaten after mistakenly knocking on the door of the wrong home in Peekskill. She died from her injuries five weeks later.
Hasseem Jenkins is charged with murder in connection to her death and has pleaded not guilty.
""New York state has the opportunity to be a leader on this issue""
Sen. Peter Harckham and Assemblymember Dana Levenberg are pushing Albany to take action.
""It is one of the 20 most dangerous jobs in America,"" Harckham said.
Their bills would increase penalties for attacking CPS workers doing their jobs and mandate counties provide portable panic alarms to social workers who visit clients in the field.
""Equipping social workers with panic buttons will give them another quicker way of getting help in case it's needed,"" Levenberg said.
Union members say they will lobby lawmakers to pass the bills before the legislative session ends in June.
""Safety is a concern everywhere. New York state has the opportunity to be a leader on this issue,"" said Hattie Adams, Department of Social Services union president.
Christine Leoce, who worked with Coto, was among the colleagues and lawmakers who gathered Friday to advocate for change.
""I still remember the police officer's voice and his chilling words when I asked if Maria was gonna be OK, and he said to me, 'I'm sorry, it's really not good,'"" Leoce said.
Westchester County doesn't need a mandate from the state to go ahead and buy the portable panic alarms, and we've learned the county has been studying the technology and soon will announce a plan to provide them to DSS staff.",

technology,Space capsule marks milestone for bringing cargo back from orbit,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/2-space-capsule-marks-milestone-for-bringing-cargo-back-from-orbit.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/space-capsule-marks-milestone-bringing-cargo-back-from-orbit,"While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.
This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics.
By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic.
This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics.
Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.
As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.
The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.
It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.
The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK.
Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.
The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.
Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.
Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.
With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.
The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.
Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past. Atmos Space Cargo's growing space capabilities could also lead to new jobs, investment and technological leadership.
Phoenix 1's successful mission is a sign that space is becoming more accessible and that innovation is happening at an unprecedented pace. By proving that rapid development and new ideas can work in the challenging environment of space, Atmos Space Cargo is paving the way for a future where space logistics are as routine as shipping goods across continents. The next generation of breakthroughs in science and technology may very well start their journey with a ride on a capsule like Phoenix.

Jefferson County looks to use ballistics technology more to solve crimes
In Jefferson County, Erin Mulligan sits at her computer in the Colorado county's regional crime lab. It's not quite ""CSI: Colorado"" but it can sometimes feel that way to her. As a forensic scientist, she works with the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network.
Forensic scientist Erin Mulligan
CBS
""We will log an item here in Colorado,"" she told CBS Colorado. ""There will be a default search area that we go through that will attempt to link shooting scenes.""
The practice has been used by law enforcement agencies since the early 2000s and has helped establish links between investigations, sometimes spanning years or across state lines. Locally, the Denver Police Department and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office were the beneficiaries of the technology to help solve a crime.
In March of 2022, a shooting took place in Arvada. No one was injured but evidence was collected from the crime scene, including a bullet casing. NIBIN tends to use shell casings as a way to cross reference gun manufacturers, serial numbers and give investigators something to work with.
CBS
""There's a proprietary algorithm in this software that just evaluates the similarity of the markings left behind by the firearm,"" Mulligan explained.
Typically, this kind of evidence can sit in the NIBIN database. But every now and then, a link will be provided which will allow agencies to reach out to one another and make a connection.
""There's a data point from that linked incident where there's a light bulb or there's a link made,"" said Mulligan.
CBS
Which is how Denver police got in touch with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. While investigating another shooting in 2023, DPD sent the casing to their crime lab, who also use NIBIN for their ballistics analysis. The database turned up a hit: the shooting from Arvada in 2022.
""The investigators can share those witness statements or the details about each of their investigation and work together,"" Mulligan added.
The suspect, Michael Esadcida, was arrested and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 16 years as the ballistics technology provided a win for NIBIN, law enforcement and public safety.",

The investment represents an advancement in AI technology, particularly in enhancing personalized interactions between businesses and their customers.
The firm will use a combination of AI tools and expertise from existing companies to provide solutions for sales, customer support and other interactions.
""We aim to use generative artificial intelligence with digital assistants that can converse the same way humans can,"" Daniel Figueirido, chief executive of Illumia, told Reuters.
""The key to the kingdom with this kind of investment is how do I combine each of these different platforms and technologies,"" he added.
A recent Reuters study, opens new tab found that 56% of Latin American respondents are excited about the technology, though 50% of them have privacy and confidentiality concerns.
Illumia has provided services to Worthein-controlled firms in Latin America and some third-party clients, said Figueirido, though he envisions Illumia expanding beyond its existing footprint in the region.

According to the mayor's office, the new zones are being established in several neighborhoods. The locations include:
• Valencia Street between 16th and 21st streets
• At Pier 39
• Ellis Street between Stockton and Powell streets
• Folsom Street between 7th and 8th streets
• Yerba Buena Lane between Market and Mission streets, and at Jessie Square
Entertainment zones allow for special events where local bars and restaurants can sell alcoholic beverages to go. The zones were authorized following the passage of Senate Bill 76 by State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco).
Lurie announced the approvals on the same day the Castro Upper Market Entertainment Zone is being launched. Last month, supervisors unanimously approved the zone in the Castro District covering Market Street between Collingwood and 14th streets, along with stretches of Castro Street and 19th Street.
""Entertainment zones bring joy and life to our streets block by block, and I'm excited to kick off the Castro Upper Market Zone and create five more entertainment zones, supporting local business while bringing fun to neighborhoods across our city,"" Lurie said in a statement. ""Together, we're building community, supporting local businesses, and giving our neighborhoods the boost they need.""
Lurie said with the latest additions, there are 21 entertainment zones adopted or pending across San Francisco.
The city's first entertainment zone was designated on Front Street between California and Sacramento streets in the city's Financial District and had its first events last year. According to the mayor's office, events such as Oktoberfest on Front, Nightmare on Front Street and Let's Glow SF have drawn more than 21,000 attendees and participating businesses have seen revenue increases of up to 1,500%.
Other entertainment zones have been established at Thrive City outside Chase Center, Harlan Place and Mark Lane near Union Square and in Cole Valley.",

So, the city of San Jose is considering a proposal that harkens back to the pandemic by opening public spaces for people to play.
On one block of Post Street, there are no cars at all. The narrow road in downtown was closed during the pandemic, and Froylan Rodriquez, who owns Dream Jewelers on the block, said traffic never really returned.
""I mean, everything was great,"" he said. ""Pretty good traffic on the street. Now, it seems like after COVID, it went really slow. It's kind of quiet. You see, the street is, like, lonely.""
Now, the city has shut it down to cars permanently, but this time is giving it a special designation in the effort to bring life back to downtown.
""By designating Post Street as one of our first entertainment zones, we're building on that momentum in allowing all the bars and restaurants here to take advantage of planned events in the future,"" said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan.
He said there are eight downtown areas named as ""entertainment zones"" where, like in New Orleans, people would be allowed to take the food and drinks they buy out into the public spaces.
""You suddenly can actually leave the premises of the restaurant or bar and walk around throughout the zone,"" said Mahan. ""And then, it's easier to integrate entertainment or art or actually have this more robust experience in a larger public space.""
That may seem like a simple idea, but it took a new state law to make it possible. Senate Bill 969, passed in September, allows cities to establish areas where consumption of alcohol on public streets would be legalized during special events.
""It's going to increase business, 100 percent,"" said Cisco Mejia, a manager at the Splash Video Dance Bar on Post Street. ""Just because that's something new that we haven't had before.""
Actually, they did have it before, during the pandemic. Post Street was closed during the lockdown for outdoor dining. But at the ""Fifty Five South"" bar, they didn't just put tables out, they actually constructed a large shipwreck in the middle of the street for customers to sit inside. Co-owner Eric Nielsen said it was just the kind of zany thing that cooped-up people were looking for.
""It was insane that we did this, but we did, and it was hugely popular for over a year and a half,"" said Nielsen. ""I think it was fantastic for the city. We had families walking down the street at all times of the day and even into the evening. And before we didn't see that, before the pandemic, we never saw that.""
Now, during special permitted events, businesses in the entertainment zones would be able to use the streets and sidewalks for outdoor events. Last week, they got a little taste of that, actually a big taste, when the city staged a block party for tens of thousands of people featuring star DJ Steve Aoki. Nielsen said it was just the boost he was hoping for.
""We did better sales-wise, but most importantly, just walking around downtown, it felt alive. It felt like a normal downtown city again. We really missed that,"" he said. ""So, yeah, anything that can help that and make people feel comfortable and give them an opportunity and an excuse to go out and see something different, do something different, and have a good time. That's kind of the key.""
During the pandemic, outdoor entertainment was meant to keep distance between people. Now, it's being used to bring them together again.",

The legendary quarterback, joined by sportscaster Jim Gray and his wife, Frann Vettor-Gray, have spearheaded the creation of the museum, located at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas hotel. It will include items from the Tom Brady Family Collection, as well as treasures from athletes and entertainers of the 20th and 21st centuries.
""The Hall of Excellence is about more than preserving history -- it is about celebrating the relentless pursuit of greatness,"" Brady said in a news release. ""These moments, these legends, they remind us of what is possible when passion and hard work come together, and they inspire us to chase our own legacies. So much of this memorabilia represents the incredible journey that I, like so many others, have been fortunate enough to experience. Artifacts like these do not belong hidden away, they should be shared with the fans who were along for the journey with us. I'm proud to share these moments, and grateful this collection now has the perfect home at Fontainebleau Las Vegas.""
The items in the collection spread far beyond Brady's.
Visitors to the museum will see items that include the bat used by Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier (1947); Michael Jordan's first pair of Air Jordans (1984); Clint Eastwood's Academy Award for ""Unforgiven"" (1993); a golf ball used by Tiger Woods during his first Masters victory (1997); Oprah Winfrey's Presidential Medal of Freedom (2013); and golf balls and baseballs signed by U.S. Presidents dating back to Woodrow Wilson.
Additional memorabilia comes from events involving icons such as Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Roger Federer, Simone Biles and Michael Phelps.
""The Hall of Excellence is the most extraordinary collection of historic sports and entertainment artifacts ever assembled. It's a tribute to iconic legends whose achievements exceeded even their boldest dreams. This museum takes you back to the unforgettable moments that shaped generations,"" Jim Gray said. ""By sharing these remarkable treasures, we hope to inspire future generations to strive for excellence. We are deeply grateful to all the superstars who generously contributed their most prized possessions.""
Academy Award-winner Morgan Freeman narrates the self-guided tour of the museum, but numerous big names -- including Winfrey, Marv Albert, Bob Costas and Snoop Dogg -- offer stories about specific items.
Admission to the Hall of Excellence is $35, with discounts available for seniors, youths, Nevada residents and military memebers.
