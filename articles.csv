The West African country's political parties are demanding a return to constitutional order and a presidential election, and they were expected to gather for a demonstration on Friday.

However, the junta said in a statement read on state TV on Wednesday that activities of political parties and other political organisations had been suspended until further notice to preserve public order.
Last week, a national conference of political actors recommended naming junta leader Assimi Goita as president with a five-year mandate. The conference also recommended the dissolution of all political parties and the tightening of conditions for the creation of new parties.
In response to that announcement, a coalition of political parties held a demonstration on May 3, saying Malians were not represented in the conference. Parties were expected to gather again on Friday.
The junta originally committed to holding elections in February 2022, but that timeline has been pushed back several times.
In 2024, Mali formed a cooperation pact known as the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) with its neighbours in the impoverished Sahel region, Burkina Faso and Niger, after severing long-standing military ties with France and other Western powers.",n/a

Authorities on Wednesday announced that all work by political parties and other political organisations had been suspended until further notice to preserve public order.
The move came ahead of planned protests in the capital, Bamako, and the city of Segou against the government, which came to power after coups in 2020 and 2021.
Government critics, including activists and opposition politicians, appeared keen to build momentum after unprecedented public gatherings on May 3 and 4 in Bamako. Those were triggered by recommendations from a national council of political actors to hand military leader Assimi Goita a five-year mandate and dissolve all political parties.
Several hundred participants carried placards displaying messages calling for multi-party elections and chanted slogans such as: ""Down with dictatorship, long live democracy.""
While organisers of Friday's protest postponed the event until further notice, calls for civil disobedience nonetheless circled on social media.
A spokesperson for Mali's Ministry of Security and Civil Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The likelihood of a mass popular uprising remains low for now, especially in a country like Mali where multiple political opponents and government critics have disappeared from public view, including one on Thursday, according to his party - but analysts said the coming days will be a critical test.
If protesters come out in larger numbers than last weekend, and are perhaps tear-gassed or arrested, it could result in an even stronger backlash, said Benedict Manzin, an analyst with strategic risk consultancy Sibylline.
If a similar number of demonstrators, or fewer, take to the streets ""because people have been intimidated into silence, then this will probably just go away"", he said.
While the council's recommendations on dissolving political parties and granting Goita a five-year mandate were an important trigger, the protests last weekend highlighted anger over a broad range of issues in a country where military leaders - who took power promising to stem the threat posed by jihadist groups - have instead overseen a worsening security situation.
""There are many factors,"" said a Malian security analyst in Bamako who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. They include insecurity as well as social issues like power cuts, the high cost of living and job losses.
""The longer it goes on, the more unsustainable it becomes,"" he said.
Much of northern Mali remains out of government control, and jihadist groups are expanding their reach and carrying out more frequent attacks around Bamako.
Last September, Al Qaeda affiliate Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed an attack in the capital that hit an elite police training academy and the airport.
With insecurity as rampant as ever, military governments not just in Mali but in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger - all former French colonies - have leaned on anti-colonial rhetoric to justify their rule.
""But that gets old,"" said Manzin.
""Livelihoods are being destroyed, the population are under threat of attack - eventually, what you need is just stability and economic well-being.""
Rather than a public uprising, a stronger threat to the current leaders would likely come from within the government itself, said Byron Cabrol, senior Africa analyst at Dragonfly.
""A wave of protests would not be enough to kind of incentivise someone [within the military government] to take action,"" he said, ""but it's undoubtedly a contributing factor, among many others.""",n/a

Judge Stefanie Moon and an investigative panel of the state Judicial Qualifications Commission on Wednesday filed a revised agreement, known as a stipulation, that went along with disciplinary measures suggested last week by the Supreme Court.
The Judicial Qualifications Commission in April recommended that Moon receive a public reprimand and pay a fine of $2,115, the amount of the political contributions. But the Supreme Court last week rejected that recommendation and said she should receive a suspension, along with being reprimanded and paying the fine.
Allegations of improper political contributions tied to Kamala Harris, Joe Biden
The commission last month filed documents at the Supreme Court that alleged Moon violated judicial canons by making political contributions, including to committees backing former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, former President Joe Biden and ActBlue, a Democratic Party fundraising arm.
In addition, Moon was accused of reminding an attorney in court that he had not returned a phone call related to her re-election campaign and improperly contacting the therapist of a man who was a party in a case and whose mental health was an issue.
The commission makes recommendations to the Supreme Court, which has ultimate authority to discipline judges.",n/a
politics,Democrats Must Embrace Their Inner Jerry Springer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/opinion/09neyfakh/09neyfakh-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/opinion/democrats-need-jerry-springer.html,"Given that Hollywood is often caricatured as a hotbed of liberalism, it's surprising that Republicans seem so much better than Democrats at the showbiz side of politics. Two Republican presidents have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, as does the former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yet among liberals there persists a sense that running celebrities for public office is somehow dÃ©classÃ©, cynical or simply not something a serious party does.
The Democrats need to reckon with a new reality: The electorate wants to be entertained. Instead of continuing to run highly credentialed political lifers, the party needs to embrace the idea of the celebrity candidate â€” and find someone with sincerely-held progressive beliefs, sky-high name recognition and experience winning over the kinds of voters who've supported the MAGA movement. In other words, they need to find someone like Jerry Springer.
Mr. Springer, who died in 2023, is best known for his gleefully distasteful TV show, which for nearly three decades featured a parade of cheating spouses, incestuous siblings and rowdy strippers who routinely erupted in brutal onstage brawls. With his glasses, jacket and tie, Mr. Springer would hang back at a safe distance, an unlikely instigator standing amid a jeering crowd and politely asking questions.
Yes, that Jerry Springer should serve as a model for the kind of standard-bearer Democrats should be looking for: a professionally famous person with an intuitive grasp of attention, a flair for drama and conflict, and a proven ability to communicate with a broad audience regardless of its political affiliations.
As a celebrity, Mr. Springer had none of the glamour of, say, a BeyoncÃ©, a George Clooney or a Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson â€” some of the names occasionally mentioned as possible political recruits. But that's the point. For Democrats, the issue of being perceived as talking down to voters is one that the party continues to struggle with. Many of the voters who improbably regard Mr. Trump, a gilded billionaire, as an everyman with a common touch, cheered for Mr. Springer because he seemed relatable and never condescending. That kind of figure, coupled with a talent for showmanship, might prove a recipe for success now, even more so than it did for Mr. Springer during the political career he began in advance of rising to fame as a talk-show host.
Before Mr. Springer became an icon of bad taste, and before his name â€” Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! â€” became a kind of tawdry war cry, he had a promising career in government. He was an idealistic and ambitious progressive reformer elected to office in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the 1970s as a city councilman. He appealed to countercultural college students and blue-collar workers alike. During his time in City Hall, he opposed the Vietnam War, led a successful campaign to create a city-owned bus system and advocated reforms at the local jail. He resigned from the City Council in 1974, following a prostitution scandal â€” a seeming career ender at the time, though one he came back from, successfully reclaiming his seat and then serving as mayor of Cincinnati.
Both his political gifts and his nose for spectacle would contribute to his rise as a big-tent TV celebrity. That tent included many of the kind of people Hillary Clinton would later label 'deplorables,' an infamous slight. Even as his studio audience â€” and many critics â€” sneered at Mr. Springer's guests and judged him for putting them on his televised circus, he always managed to seem genuinely interested in them: their feelings, their decisions and occasionally their hopes for the future.
After Mr. Springer ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in the Ohio governor's race in 1982, he essentially stumbled into a career in media â€” first as a pundit delivering commentaries on the news, then as an Emmy-winning evening news anchor, then, starting in 1991, as the host of a daytime talk show focused on current affairs and human interest stories.
After a stretch of incurably low ratings, 'The Jerry Springer Show' began its transformation into the shocking free-for-all that we remember, and he became an international celebrity. But he spent the rest of his life looking for ways to get back into politics, even as his infamy made the prospect less viable. He seriously explored running for statewide office again in Ohio during three separate election cycles, starting around the time of his show's commercial peak in the late 1990s. He found that neither voters nor party leaders were willing to look past his TV show: A University of Cincinnati poll in 2003 found that he had an unfavorability rating of 71 percent.
Many found the idea of Mr. Springer in the Senate not just implausible but offensive. Representative Ted Strickland, who would later become Ohio's governor, denounced Mr. Springer as someone 'who abuses damaged, vulnerable people for his own purpose' and swore he'd never share a stage with him.
Mr. Springer ended up not running in 2003, channeling his passion for politics into a radio show on Air America, the short-lived experiment in progressive talk radio. His radio show â€” on which he talked about issues like abortion, the death penalty and public education â€” aired alongside that of another entertainer turned political aspirant: the former 'Saturday Night Live' comedian and future senator from Minnesota, Al Franken.
It was in 2017, the year after Mr. Trump's election, that Mr. Springer and his inner circle of supporters thought perhaps his moment had finally come, and they began kicking the tires on a campaign for governor of Ohio. If Americans could be convinced to vote for one famous guy they'd seen on a cheesy TV show, why wouldn't they embrace another? As Mr. Springer said of Mr. Trump, 'His constituency is basically mine. These are fans of the show.'
Several of Mr. Springer's advisers told me that, in a general election, they had no doubt he would have won the Ohio statehouse, by bringing home the kinds of lifelong Democratic voters who had switched to Mr. Trump in 2016. An Ohio State senator, Bill DeMora, told me of Springer fans: 'They related to somebody like Jerry Springer, because he talked to them, not down to them.'
In hindsight, Mr. Springer's story lends credence to the notion that politics and entertainment have more in common than we like to admit. If nothing else, Democrats must get past their aversion to the unseriousness of celebrity and treat it as a selling point, not a stumbling block. Why not Oprah Winfrey? Or the ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith? Or the 'Shark Tank' personality and billionaire Mark Cuban? Just pick someone who's willing to run, who's good at their job, and who lots of people like. Democrats would do well not to let the next Jerry Springer slip away.",n/a

Instead, his audience numbers came in at half their usual level.
The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.
""I was expecting a bump in the figures,"" said Marsh, who first posted the 35-minute sitdown in the lead-up to the last election, in 2022, and again three weeks before Saturday's vote which returned Albanese to power. ""Truth be told, I was surprised that the listener downloads for the prime minister were noticeably lower than for other popular culture figures.""
A campaign dominated by podcasts, TikTok and other non-mainstream media was widely credited with U.S. President Donald Trump's win last year.
But an attempt by Australian politicians to do the same fell flat in 2025, according to publicly available data and an analysis of social media activity conducted exclusively for Reuters.
Australia's 2025 election was its first where all major party leaders went on podcasts and ran personal TikTok accounts.
But voters largely tuned out of online political discussions after the campaign began in March and particularly since Trump sent geopolitical shockwaves by announcing sweeping tariffs on April 2, the analysis shows.
""While there is no question that social media and podcasts do play an important role, I think in this particular election, that has to be viewed as secondary to the most dominant political trend in the world, and that is Trump,"" said Gordon Flake, CEO of foreign policy think tank, the Perth USAsia Centre.
After Albanese's March 26 appearance on lifestyle podcast ""Happy Hour with Lucy and Nikki"", ""comments per 100 likes"" for the show's TikTok account - a closely watched measure of audience engagement - fell by two-thirds by late April.
A 48-minute interview with Albanese on popular YouTube channel Ozzy Man Reviews ranked 18th out of the channel's last 20 videos. It had just over half the views of a post called ""Why Sheilas Live Longer Than Blokes"" and about one-third the views of a video about Olympic breakdancer Raygun, according to data published on the streaming website.
Ozzy Man presenter Ethan Marrell said the decline was due to fewer overseas viewers and his Albanese interview reached the same number of Australians as his other content. ""I'm pleased with how it performed,"" he said by phone.
LIKES ARE NOT VOTES
The opposition conservative coalition generated one-third more likes on its heavily meme-driven TikTok page than the governing Labor Party, according to published data, but still lost Australia's first election where most voters were aged 44 and under, the platform's main demographic.
The left-wing Greens party also performed poorly despite some high-profile influencer support, losing at least two of their four House of Representatives members, including TikTok's most-followed Australian lawmaker, Max Chandler-Mather.
""Often social media is a useful way of setting the agenda in mainstream media,"" said Jill Sheppard, a political scientist who works on the Australian Election Study, the country's biggest research project on voting behaviour. ""That doesn't seem to have happened in this election.""
Australia's compulsory voting system effectively overrides the need to encourage non-voters to the ballot box, as Trump's appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience and other podcasts was credited with doing, Sheppard said.
Plus Australian influencers were typically inexperienced political interviewers and candidate campaigns had become ""so risk-averse and so scripted that the audiences can't be really enjoying it"", she said.
'BEHAVIORAL DISENGAGEMENT'
After the conservative opposition led most polls for nearly a year against a government accused of failing to fix a living cost crisis, an abrupt turnaround coincided with the start of the campaign and Trump's constantly changing tariff regime which roiled markets - and pension fund balances.
Engagement with politics on social media plummeted around the same time, according to U.S. disinformation tracker Cyabra. Analysis conducted for Reuters showed an 84% decline in Australian election-related posts, likes and comments from the start of April, compared to the month before, from 13,000 posts across 6,000 accounts on Facebook and X.
The downturn suggested ""a deeper behavioral disengagement from political discourse in Australia's online ecosystem"", the company said.
Decisions by social media giants including Facebook and Instagram owner Meta (META.O), opens new tab and X to cut content moderation had enabled more misinformation, ""creating voters that are sceptical and, frankly, exhausted by the deluge of political messaging being aimed in their direction"", said Adam Marre, chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf.
On Reddit, concern about Trump was ""strongly observable"" across 20 Australian political forums analysed by Queensland University of Technology's Digital Observatory. Users frequently drew parallels between opposition conservative leader Peter Dutton and Trump, particularly in the campaign's early stages, said data scientist Mat Bettinson.
""Trump is probably having more of an impact than any single influencer online at the moment,"" said Finley Watson, a researcher of social media and politics at La Trobe University.
""Economic uncertainty tends to favour the incumbent and Trump has been probably one of the more dominant salient aspects of this election.""

politics,Today Harvard Is the Target. Tomorrow It Could Be Your Church.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/09claybourn-czpl/09claybourn-czpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/opinion/trump-harvard-tax.html,"Conservatives like me once instinctively understood that expanding government power â€” even briefly â€” invites harm. Yet recent attempts by President Trump's administration to use the tax code as a weapon reveal how easily partisanship can override wisdom.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status as part of his feud with the school over its response to antisemitism and perceived ideological bias. On Wednesday, he floated the idea of stripping other universities of their exemptions. Meanwhile, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, a Trump ally, accused Wikipedia's parent organization of allowing foreign propaganda and suggested that it, too, might be failing its obligations as a nonprofit.
Many on the right have welcomed these aggressive moves as overdue pushback against liberal dominance in academia and media. That's a mistake â€” one that conservatives could come to regret. Whether or not Mr. Trump ultimately succeeds, his attempt to weaponize the tax code sets a troubling and dangerous precedent.
If the executive branch can threaten Wikipedia and universities today, what would stop a leftist administration from targeting churches and synagogues tomorrow?
Imagine a scenario: It's 2029, and a progressive Democrat sits in the Oval Office. Federal auditors descend on evangelical churches after pastors preach that marriage should only be between a man and a woman, labeling their words 'political advocacy.' Synagogues face regulatory investigations for teachings on gender and sexuality that offend prevailing cultural orthodoxies. Faith-based charities, suddenly saddled with endless bureaucratic forms and invasive reporting requirements, find their missions suffocating beneath paperwork. Smaller congregations fold under legal expenses while larger institutions self-censor out of fear. Soon the pulpit is muted, faith leaders are intimidated into silence, and communities are stripped of their authentic voices.
Far-fetched? Hardly. Unchecked executive power rarely contracts voluntarily. Progressives have long advocated re-examining the tax-exempt status of religious institutions that engage with politically sensitive issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. Conservatives rightly condemned the Obama administration when the Internal Revenue Service selectively scrutinized conservative Tea Party groups that applied for tax-exempt status, subjecting them to prolonged bureaucratic hurdles and legal battles.
What we are seeing today under Mr. Trump, however, is of a different scale. This administration is engaging in administrative bias and openly using tax status threats as a political tool. It has elevated intimidation to official policy.
Such threats stand on dubious legal ground. Revoking tax-exempt status typically depends on clear-cut regulatory breaches or financial misconduct. These efforts have already ignited substantial backlash, and their ability to survive judicial scrutiny is doubtful.
Weaponizing tax policy to punish ideological opponents contradicts fundamental conservative principles about limiting government power. Conservatism insists that unchecked authority inevitably leads to abuse because human nature is inherently flawed and power corrupts easily. When government institutions â€” intended to be impartial guardians of law and order â€” are driven by partisan motives, they become instruments of oppression rather than protectors of liberty. This not only violates conservative ideals but also weakens public trust and undermines the very democratic institutions conservatives seek to preserve.
The wisest conservatives understood a simple truth: Preserving liberty demands practicing restraint, especially toward those you oppose. Ronald Reagan put it plainly when he said that freedom is 'never more than one generation away from extinction.' Cowing political adversaries through executive fiat may realize short-term gains, but it guarantees long-term peril.
America's constitutional order rests on self-restraint as well as on the formal separation of powers. Conservatives must resist today's easy victories for the sake of tomorrow's freedoms. The real safeguard against abuses is not simply legal boundaries but moral discipline. The preservation of our democratic institutions and constitutional freedoms demands that conservatives recommit practically, not just rhetorically, to the ideals of limited and responsible government.
It might seem fanciful to expect a Republican Party, still deeply enthralled by Mr. Trump's combative brand of politics, to suddenly reclaim this kind of governance. Yet even now, within the G.O.P., there is a group that clings stubbornly to the conservative traditions of prudence and restraint. Figures such as Representative Don Bacon, Senator Rand Paul, former Representative Justin Amash and the scholar Yuval Levin continue to advocate politics defined by modesty and self-control rather than raw power and retribution.
This group, though currently outshouted and overshadowed, understands that enduring influence is built on moral clarity and consistency, not momentary dominance. If these conservatives and others who share their values can muster the courage to resist the excesses of the status quo, they could yet become an essential force for restoring balance and integrity to our political life.
The alternative â€” unchecked cycles of ideological retribution â€” risks permanently destabilizing the political and social fabric that makes America exceptional. Conservatives bear a unique responsibility to champion restraint, ensuring that government remains a servant of liberty rather than its master.",n/a

Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., announced the DOGE Committee, the House subcommittee focused on delivering government efficiency, will hold a hearing on keeping men out of women's sports.
Burchett posted a video to his X account explaining important initiatives this week, leading with this hearing.
""We're seeing how crazy that's gotten with Riley Gaines and the rest of the crew that really put it out to the public,"" Burchett said.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
""The president has issued an executive order, which some people are ignoring. We're going to hear some really horrific stories of young ladies who really had their careers stolen from them, and some of them, their health.""
Burchett has been proactive prior to President Donald Trump's executive order, ""No Men in Women's Sports,"" being signed.
Burchett voted in favor of H.J.Res. 165, which would overturn a Biden administration rule that allowed men who identified as women to be protected under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.
TRUMP MOCKS TRANS ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS TO ROARING APPLAUSE AT ALABAMA COMMENCEMENT SPEECH
""Title IX of the Civil Rights Act was passed to protect women from being unfairly denied opportunities in education and sports. Allowing men to compete in women's sports takes trophies, changes, and even careers away from hardworking female athletes."" Burchett said during his debate remarks on the House floor in July 2024.
The bill eventually passed, 210-205.
Trump's executive order was signed in February on National Girls and Women in Sports Day, which celebrates female athletes in women's sports and those committed to providing equal access to sports for all females.
""This doesn't have to be long. It's all about common sense,"" Trump said before signing the order.
""The war on women's sports is over,"" he added.
One day later, the NCAA revised its gender eligibility policy to restrict participation in the women's category to only biological females. However, the new policy has been criticized by some women's sports activists for not going far enough.
Still, several states, including California and Maine, are not abiding by the executive order.
Trump recently spoke at the University of Alabama during its graduation ceremony, where he gave a shoutout to the school's SEC-champion women's track and field team. He used that to segue into his vow to ""defend women's sports.""
""As long as I'm president, we will always protect women's sports. Men will not play in women's sports,"" Trump said before the crowd erupted in cheers.

""No way. They say it's an 80-20 issue. No, it's a 97-3 issue, I think,"" Trump added. ""No, men will not be playing in women's sports. I said that, and I classified it with a very powerful executive order, as you know. It's done.""

The Portuguese capital rivals both have 78 points, with Sporting top by virtue of winning the first clash between the teams 1-0 at the Jose Alvalade stadium back in December.
If Sporting win on Saturday they will be champions, while if Benfica triumph by at least a two-goal margin they will reclaim the title with a superior head-to-head record.
A one-goal victory for Benfica would mean the title being decided next weekend when goal difference could come into play, with Sporting currently three goals better off than Benfica.
If the match is drawn, Sporting will retain the title by at least matching their rival's result on the final matchday.
With third-placed Porto long out of the title race, trailing 13 points behind the top two and level on 65 points with Braga, the Lisbon rivalry between Benfica and Sporting has dominated the campaign and not only in the league.
Benfica beat Sporting on penalties in the League Cup final in January and they will meet again at the iconic Jamor National Stadium in the Portuguese Cup final on May 25.
It will be a clash of two coaches who took charge of struggling sides in mid-season and got them back on track.
Rui Borges in late December replaced Joao Pereira, who lasted only 42 days after he was named Sporting manager following Ruben Amorim's move to Manchester United.
Amorin left Sporting in comfortable position at the top but a series of bad results forced the club to make a quick change and hire the 43-year-old Borges from Vitoria Guimaraes.
Sporting were already feeling the heat from Bruno Lage's Benfica, who was hired in September for a second tenure after Roger Schmidt was fired only four matchdays into the season.",n/a

An angry knock on the door. Death threats. An avalanche of political pressure, leading to a hearing scheduled for Wednesday in Washington.
The niche sport of fencing is usually not one that elicits fevered emotion beyond the thrust and parry of its matches. But it has become the latest sporting flashpoint following President Trump's executive order in February to block transgender athletes from competing in girl's and women's sports events.
Athletes have been affected at the youth, high school and college level, but the cultural firestorm has extended to all levels and types of competition, including Olympic sports.
The Trump administration is seeking to restrict who will be eligible to compete in women's events at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, which will include fencing competition. It has ordered American consulates to deny visas to transgender athletes who seek to enter the United States for sports events.",n/a
sports,President Donald Trump plans to create commission on college athletics: Sources,https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/05/07195107/GettyImages-2213213417-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6341165/2025/05/07/donald-trump-commission-on-college-athletics,"Former Alabama head coach Nick Saban and Texas Tech board of regents chairman Cody Campbell would co-chair the commission President Donald Trump is interested in forming to examine the long list of issues facing college sports, a source briefed on the plans told The Athletic.
The source said Trump is expected to be 'very engaged' with the commission because he sees the current state of college sports as an issue of national importance.

The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Trump was interested in weighing in with an executive order after the president spoke last week with Saban, who has expressed concern that college sports is being harmed by the big money pouring into it to compensate athletes with little regulation. Yahoo! Sports first reported Wednesday that Trump is planning to create a presidential commission to examine a long list of issues facing college sports, from booster-funded payments and transfer rules to conference alignment and Title IX.
Campbell, who was elected chairman of the Texas Tech board of regents last month, is a former Red Raiders football player and one of the university's most prominent donors. He is the co-founder and co-executive of Double Eagle Energy Holdings, an upstream oil and gas company based out of Fort Worth, Texas, which operates extensively in the Permian Basin region of West Texas. Campbell is also the co-founder of the Matador Club, an NIL collective that supports Texas Tech athletics, and he recently spearheaded the new $242 million south endzone project at Tech's Jones AT&T Stadium, which overlooks Cody Campbell Field.
In February, Double Eagle sold a development for $4.1 billion, and in 2021, the company sold a previous development for $6.4 billion. Last month, Double Eagle announced a continued and expanded partnership with EnCap Investments, a prominent private equity company that specializes in the oil and gas industry. Campbell is a board member of Texas Public Policy Foundation and a distinguished fellow at the America First Policy Institute, the latter which has been integral to President Trump's second-term policy agenda.
A presidential commission would typically dig into various aspects of an issue or enterprise and deliver a report suggesting possible solutions that could involve executive and legislative action. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order creating the Religious Liberty Commission.

A spokeswoman for Rep. Michael Baumgartner, a freshman Republican from Washington who recently put forth an expansive bill to reform college sports, said he welcomed Trump's involvement.
'College sports is a highly subsidized public good and should be regulated like the public good it is. A presidential commission offers the chance to bring fiscal sanity; restore regional conferences and competitive balance; and protect the future of non-revenue and Olympic sports,' the spokeswoman said in a statement to The Athletic.
It's unclear how a commission would impact the current developments in college sports, including a potential landmark agreement to settle a trio of antitrust lawsuits facing the NCAA and major conferences and establish for the first time a system of direct payments from schools to athletes.
The settlement awaits final approval from a federal judge, who ordered the defendants to tweak part of the agreement that sets new roster limits for NCAA Division I schools that opt into the deal.
The latest revised filing has been made in the House v. NCAA settlement, regarding roster limits.
Any athlete who has been or would have been cut as a result of the settlement can be ""grandfathered in,"" meaning they will not count against the new roster limits for the durationâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/Wco5hLoVyt
â€” Justin Williams (@Williams_Justin) May 7, 2025
College sports leaders and attorneys for the defendants remain confident the judge will sign off on the deal.
Even if the settlement is approved, college sports leaders have acknowledged that it will need the backing of federal legislation, which they have been, for years, lobbying Congress for.
Tom McMillen, the former Democratic congressman who for several years led an association of athletic directors whose schools compete at the highest level of Division I, praised Trump for getting involved.

'I give President Trump a lot of credit. This is a time to bring the best minds in college sports together, in higher education, and figure a model out,' said McMillen, who has known Trump for more than 50 years.
'He's always had a big interest in sports. It really fits his kind of whole M.O.'
Applauding @POTUS Trump for considering a presidential commission on college sportsâ€”something I first called for 11 years ago. The conversation is long overdue.ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/7W7ZyFdpFE https://t.co/EsKuyM0Ssy
â€” Tom McMillen (@TomMcMillen611) May 7, 2025
McMillen first called for a presidential commission on college sports more than a decade ago. He said that while there has been some progress toward a bipartisan bill in Congress, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) leading the efforts, presidential leadership could help prioritize the issue for Congress.
'I've always said you're going to need a presidential push to get something done,' said McMillen, who was a star basketball player at Maryland, a longtime NBA player and member of the 1972 Olympic team.
He also recalled how a commission on Olympic Sports that was formed by President Gerald Ford in 1975 led to the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 and substantive reform that boosted the United States' performance in subsequent games.
A commission on college sports could help lead to long-term reform without interrupting what is already in motion, McMillen said.
'Not gonna be overnight, but it could be very, very symbolic and very significant for higher ed and college sports, and for America,' McMillen said.

The bill passed, 32-18, with five Democrats crossing party lines to join with all 27 Republicans in voting ""yes."" The vote marked the second time the GOP-controlled Senate has passed it. An earlier attempt, in concert with a Republican-controlled House, met then-Gov. Tom Wolf's veto pen in 2022.
This time, Senate Republicans are advancing the effort after President Donald Trump declared his intent to ""keep men out of women's sports."" and made it a major campaign issue in last year's election, dividing Democrats on how to respond.
The bill applies to participation in girls' and women's sports that are sponsored by public schools, public universities and publicly chartered community colleges.
It also prohibits any sort of government agency or athletic association from investigating or punishing a school or higher education institution for maintaining separate sports teams for girls or women.
For well over an hour, Republicans and Democrats debated the bill, at times hotly. The sponsor, Sen. Judy Ward, a Republican from Blair County, said the bill would ""ensure all young women have a fair chance to compete in the sports they love.""
Ward said that since 2020 in Pennsylvania, 37 female athletes have lost first place and another 13 lost second or third place, although she didn't say from where she drew the statistics. Pennsylvania's governing body for high school sports, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said it was aware of just one transgender student currently participating in sports.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, a Democrat from Allegheny County, called the bill discriminatory against transgender people, as well as ""unnecessary, unwarranted and unconstitutional in my mind.""
Democrats warned that the bill will go nowhere in the House, and a spokesperson for House Democratic leaders accused Senate Republicans of being ""more focused on divisive political theater and bullying kids for political points.""
Gov. Josh Shapiro's office did not respond to an inquiry Tuesday about the bill, although the Democrat has in the past expressed opposition to such bans, calling 2022's bill ""nothing more than cruel, designed to discriminate against transgender youth who just want to play sports like their peers.""
Trump, as president, signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.
In February, the PIAA changed its policy in a move that some officials said was designed to follow Trump's order, except that lawyers on both sides of the issue say the change in policy wording does nothing of the sort.
Previously, the PIAA's policy had deferred to school principals to determine an athlete's ""gender"" when ""questioned or uncertain."" It changed the policy to defer to principals to determine a student's ""sex"" when ""questioned or uncertain,"" and added a line that says that, in accordance with Trump's executive order, ""schools are required to consult with their school solicitors relative to compliance with the order.""
In response to Trump's order, the NCAA revised its transgender participation policy to limit women's college sports to athletes assigned as female at birth. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a governing body for smaller schools, effectively banned transgender athletes in 2023 from women's sports.",n/a

A settlement in the case of House v. NCAA would allow all Division I schools to share revenue directly with student athletes if it receives final approval this month.
The current system of NIL compensation, in effect since summer 2021, has faced its share of scrutiny. But universities paying athletes directly would all but erase the ""amateurism"" that historically defined American college sports.

Former NFL and college football player Jack Brewer is heavily opposed to the concept.
""We need to get back to student-athletes,"" Brewer told Fox News Digital.
""If a person wants the freedom to make as much money as they want and can leverage the sport to do that, they should absolutely be able to â€” and they can, in our professional leagues. But there's no place for an unlimited amount of money to be paid to people in college sports. They should be student-athletes, which is what they signed up to be.""
FLORIDA'S WALTER CLAYTON JR. RECALLS FINAL AGAINST HOUSTON
Brewer argued that revenue sharing would worsen a problem created by NIL since its 2021 legalization â€” declining graduation rates.
""You'll continue to see students who are no longer focused on school because their incentive for going to college is no longer to get an education, but to make money,"" Brewer said. ""It's not right for universities to exploit this loophole, recruiting student-athletes who no longer have to focus on being students.""

The episode also featured the return of Kate Fagan, who left the network in 2018. Fagan made a plea for ""trans kids"" in sports.
""I know it's my last time on [the show], and I want to say something worthy of that platform, and that's trans kids deserve to play sports,"" she said. ""Think about what you remember from your time playing sports. Ninety-nine percent of it is finding that jersey for the first time, your favorite number, community, joy, those high-fives.
""It's that moment when you have a great play with a teammate. It's the feeling of belonging. And it does not know gender. Trans kids deserve the same as everyone else doesâ€¦ Sports is joy. Sports is humanity. And the more people who have that, the better.""
There is no law or order that bans transgender children from participating in sports. Trump signed an executive order in February that prohibits biological males identifying as girls or women from competing against biological females.
Shortly after it was announced the show was ending, former panelist Jay Mariotti, who was a regular on the show until a domestic violence arrest in 2010, said in an interview the show is being canceled because it went ""woke.""

Fagan has made appearances on the show since she was first hired by ESPN in 2012. She left the network in 2018 but has continued to appear on the program.
Fagan was determined to be the ""winner"" of Thursday's show against Jemele Hill, who made a return to the show since leaving the network in 2018. The winner of the episode typically delivers a short monologue, and Fagan said ""being on this show has been a privilege and a platform.""

sports,India's icy indifference to winter sport frustrates trailblazer Keshavan,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMFRN73QYNKAFDBAVL4JSUQAG4.jpg?auth=3df657fad61b01f917fbf924b539bffcee9d732698beaa7b908a00409371c023&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-icy-indifference-winter-sport-frustrates-trailblazer-keshavan-2025-05-06,"NEW DELHI, May 6 (Reuters) - Twenty seven years since his Winter Olympics debut with a borrowed sled in Nagano, Shiva Keshavan cannot help feeling that the more things change, the more they remain the same.
The former luger knows what it feels to be the only Indian in an Olympic Village - he was a one-man team in the first two of his six appearances at the Winter Games.
here.
Likewise, Alpine skier Arif Mohammad Khan was the only Indian at the 2022 Beijing Games in Beijing and could be again next year in Milan-Cortina, Italy.
""Fundamentally, nothing has changed,"" Keshavan told Reuters from Italy, the birthplace of his mother. ""Fundamentally, we are still struggling to get off the starting blocks.
""Right now, (winter sport) athletes are coming up despite the system, not because of the system.""
The system is largely on paper.
India has only a handful of ski resorts, three indoor ice rinks, one certified Alpine slope, and no culture of winter sports.
""You cannot practise in a pond and hope to win an Olympic medal in swimming,"" Ice Hockey Association of India secretary general Harjinder Singh told Reuters.
There are also luge and ski federations but none enjoy the National Sports Federation (NSF) status that would entitle them to regular government funds because not enough states participate in their sports.
Keshavan often competed with borrowed sleds and hand-me-down jackets. He had to crowdfund some of his Olympic trips and had thousands of names of donors etched on his suit at the 2014 Sochi Games.
The cricket-mad nation has warmed up to the Summer Olympics and is even preparing a bid for the 2036 Games but winter sports continue to languish outside public consciousness.
""We are missing some very basic steps,"" Keshavan said.
""There's no official recognition of any single winter sport and unless that changes, nothing will change.""
Despite being one of the world's most populous nations, it took India four decades to send their first athlete to the Winter Olympics in Innsbruck in 1964.
Alpine skier Jeremy Bujakowski, who was born to Polish parents in Lithuania before moving to India, failed to finish either of his events and was 53rd and 65th when he returned to the Olympics in 1968, again alone.
NO MEDAL
It was to be another two decades until India was again represented with the first woman, Shailaja Kumar, among the three alpine skiers at the 1988 Games in Calgary.
Keshavan made his debut at the 1998 Games and was part of the record contingent of four athletes that went to the 2006 Turin Games.
In all, there have been 16 Winter Olympians from India. None has won a medal.
Reuters reached out to several Indian Olympic Association officials, including president PT Usha, but none was available to comment.
""Obviously, the scope for winter sports is limited to certain areas but the population of those areas will outnumber many European nations,"" Keshavan, 43, said.
The buzz around India's 2036 Olympic bid makes him optimistic that the prevailing frost of apathy towards winter sports may have started thawing.
""The world knows that India is a sleeping giant in sports,"" he said.
""It's only now that we've really started talking in bigger terms. It's only now that we've started talking about hosting Olympics.
""People now beginning to realise it's not just about winning medals, it's about creating a healthy nation.""
Ice hockey chief Singh is hoping a new sports bill, currently being prepared by the government, would tweak rules and grant the NSF status to the IHAI and other winter sport federations.
""I was asked to give my suggestions. Hopefully something good will come out of this new bill,"" he said.",n/a

David Carr, Kyle Dake, Trent Hidlay, Kyle Snyder and Aaron Brooks will participate in the unscripted wrestling series. The five men enter the league via SuckerPunch Entertainment, a sports management agency that specializes in combat sports.
""David, Kyle, Aaron, Trent, and Kyle represent the best of the best, and that's who we're targeting for Real American Freestyle,"" pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, the commissioner of Real American Freestyle, said in a news release. ""Our goal is to give these athletes an opportunity to continue their careers, create a platform for greatness, and inspire a legacy that lasts
Carr was a two-time national champion at Iowa State as well as an under-20 world champion. Dake won a bronze medal at the Tokyo and Paris Olympics as well as a four-time national champion at Cornell.
Brooks was a four-time national champion at Penn State and won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics. Hidlay was a four-time All-American but was never able to win the national championship at N.C. State. He won the ACC title four times.
Snyder is known as ""Captain America."" The former Ohio State star was the youngest-ever athlete to win a world, NCAA and Olympic championship in the same year. He was also the first Olympic gold medalist to return to college. He served on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during President Donald Trump's first term.
Ben Askren, Kennedy Blades, Zahid Valencia were announced as the first wrestlers to join Real American Freestyle upon its launch.
Hogan and Eric Bischoff explained to Fox News Digital last month they are trying to make freestyle wrestling mainstream.
""It's a completely underserved sport, meaning there's no professional league that allows these amateurs to evolve like they would in any other sports and it's such an underserved market, and I know, having spent a little bit of time in amateur wrestling as a kid, these are unique athletes,"" Bischoff said.
""Every athlete is committed, they have to be disciplined, but there's something about individual sports, particularly, wrestling, it's just a different kind of grind, and you have to be wired a little differently to be successful at it.""
The first set of matches is set for Aug. 30.

sports,Why African arm wrestling is growing in strength,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2079436497.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://edition.cnn.com/sport/africa-arm-wrestling-olympics-asibey-spc-intl,"For an instantly recognizable contest that has settled untold scores it is, ironically, hard to get a firm grip on the origins of arm wrestling.
As host of the World Armwrestling Federation's (WAF) inaugural World Championship in 1979, the Canadian city of Wetaskiwin could claim to be the birthplace of the formal, global sport, yet descriptions of rivals locked in battles of the biceps stretch back much further.
Versions of arm wrestling had already taken root across Japan, Spain and Cuba before the turn of the 20th century, according to anthropologists of the time. Some have even claimed it is depicted in the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt, though these assertions have been contested.
Whatever its place in arm wrestling's origin story, Africa is not looking back.
Last March saw the sport make its first appearance at the 13th African Games in Accra, Ghana, a debut orchestrated by Armwrestling Federation of Africa (AFA) President Charles Osei Asibey.
It was the latest step towards Asibey delivering on the promises of his 2022 election manifesto: to make arm wrestling a 'household' sport on the continent.
'Formerly in Africa, it was only a way to determine the strongest in the community, or even in schools,' Asibey told CNN. 'So people didn't even consider arm wrestling as a sport. It was just a normal game â€¦ We have turned it into a sport.'
The technical term for an arm wrestler is a 'puller' and it is technique, not raw power, that makes a champion, stresses Asibey, with training programs focused on developing all aspects of the body.
'A lightweight who is smarter, has speed, [and] can swing very well will beat a heavier weight,' explained Asibey, who competed until last year.
Such a matchup would not happen at the competitive level, with pullers classed into sex and weight categories, akin to boxing and mixed martial arts. And just as boxing has varying orthodox and southpaw stances, arm wrestling has its own battling styles that play to a puller's personal strengths.
The toproll style, for example, sees pullers turn their wrist inwards (pronation), and often lean back, to increase leverage, while the hook technique involves the outward rotation of the wrist (supination) to create a hook shape with the arm and pull the opponent in.
Taller pullers with long arm spans make natural toprollers, while the hook style can be hugely effective for those with a background in powerlifting, bench-pressing or similar disciplines that prioritize tricep strength.
During contests, the pullers' faces are a visceral picture of steely concentration, sinew-straining effort, and fierce competition, but it is the mutual respect that defines the sport for Asibey.
'Even in defeat, you congratulate your opponent,' he said. 'You get to the table, you shake hands â€¦ you go off the table, you shake hands and hug each other.'
Arm wrestling's debut at last year's African Games was a homecoming in all senses of the word for Asibey, with the Accra-born former broadcast journalist having founded the Ghana Armwrestling Federation in 2016.
The hosts amassed 41 of the 84 total arm wrestling medals. That put them comfortably clear of Egypt's 19-medal haul, but the North African nation gathered six more arm wrestling golds than Ghana to finish top of the medal table.
Two pullers in particular embodied the team's 'Golden Arms' moniker, accounting for half of Ghana's eight gold medals between them.
Men's captain Edward Asamoah powered to victory in the 90kg weight class for both left and right arms. A member of the Ghana Immigration Service, in 2017 Asamoah decided to try his luck at a national competition and set in motion a rollercoaster adventure.
'The journey hasn't been very smooth, with injuries and financing, but it was worth it,' he told CNN. 'Determination and hard work got me those medals.'
It has been a similar breakneck rise for Grace Minta, a police officer who followed up her two golds in Accra by becoming the first Ghanaian to win a World Armwrestling Championships gold, in Moldova five months later.
Having dominated continental events, becoming World Champion marked a new high for three-time African Championships gold medalist Minta, who took up the sport in 2017 after excelling in javelin and shotput at school.
'I'm so, so proud to be a Ghana arm wrestler,' Minta told CNN. 'I want to train the young ones who are coming, to organize them to also become somebody in the future.'
The challenge for Africa now is to replicate Minta's success more regularly â€” no easy feat given the established giants of the sport.
Kazakhstan dominated last year's world championships, scooping 52 golds as part of a 159-medal surge. Turkey and Georgia finished second and third in the medal leaderboard.
Egypt led the African contingent in 36th, two places ahead of Ghana, a fair reflection of their status as the 'top notch' arm wrestling outfit on the continent, according to Asibey.
He says that while Africa, which currently has nine nations signed up as members to the WAF, is well on its way, securing more funding will help close the gap to nations like Kazakstan which â€” partly thanks to the popularity of the sport in schools â€” sends more than 100 competitors to World Championship events.
'That's why they always dominate, because in those countries they have taken the sport very seriously,' Asibey said.
'The Africa Games brought a lot of good things. Governments and institutions have recognized us â€¦ (But) We don't have sponsorship yet. We struggle to raise money.'
'We are confident that where we are going, very soon, multinational or corporate institutions will come to invest in our sport,' he added.
Such backing would help Asibey to secure arm wrestling's African Games return in Cairo for 2027. But while that is his short-term focus, he has even bigger aspirations.
Though the WAF was unsuccessful in its bid to see para-armwrestling included in the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, Asibey â€” who doubles as one of five WAF vice-presidents â€” believes it is just a matter of time before it makes the cut.
That will be one step closer to his ultimate goal of seeing pullers battle it out on the Olympic stage. By ensuring arm wrestling is a regular fixture at his own continental games, he believes he is doing his part to make that dream a reality in the near future.
'We are working so hard to be in the Olympics,' Asibey said. 'Very soon we will get there â€¦ (Then) I'll have a good sleep.'",n/a

The one that people were shelling out so much money to try and find?
Well now, DICK's House of Sport in Ross Township gets to house the card that everyone was looking for.
Pirates fans gather to get the first look
The line before opening wasn't around the block.
""I really wanted to see the card,"" Amy Boyle of Ross Township said.
This is still a dedicated bunch. Travis Rogan of Beaver County was first in line at 7:30 Friday morning.
""I was driving down into the city â€“ and then I had some free time this morning after that, so I figured, why not come up here?"" Beaver said.
At 9 a.m., it was time to file in towards the shrine for the prized possession. Rogan, of course, got to walk up first.
""I was really taken â€“ blown away at the level of care that went into the display of it,"" he said.
The display the card is in is made of tempered glass.
""It is actually non-breakable, it's ballistic proof â€“ and in the actual casing around it is a 1500 pound safe,"" Toni Roeller, EVP of Store Experience and Design at DICK's Sporting Goods, said.
Among the caps and jerseys in that part of the store are also odes to our city.
""There's like the steel plate â€“ as like a nod to Pittsburgh,"" Roeller said.
The people at DICK's say it means a lot for them, and the community.
""The fanhood of sports is so important for us â€“ and we feel like this brings a special piece of sports history to our house of sports store in Pittsburgh,"" David Progar, Dick's Sporting Goods SVP of Team Sports, Licensed, and golf.
It's something the people in the bunch outside were amazed by.
""Really nice, it's great that it's here for everyone to see,"" Boyle said.
There could be a lot of people coming this weekend to see this card.
Just know that through the weekend â€“ Dick's House of Sport in Ross Township will have a wristband process if you do want to come and see it.
Card nets $1.1 million at auction, comes home to Pittsburgh
In March, the card headed to auction, where bidding took place in a frenzy with prices rising quickly.
It would ultimately sell for $1.11 million to, at the time, an anonymous bidder.
Just hours after its sale was finalized, DICK's Sporting Goods announced they were the ones to pony up the more than $1 million.
""DICK'S is passionate about bringing fans closer to the game,"" said Ed Stack, Executive Chairman, DICK'S. ""Acquiring the Paul Skenes MLB Debut Patch card enables us to celebrate his incredible talent while giving our athletes a unique opportunity to experience a piece of baseball history up close. We're thrilled to bring this special card home and display it in our Pittsburgh House of Sport store, where it can inspire the next generation of athletes and collectors.""
California Collector turns down Pirates' massive offer for card
Early in 2025, the card that had been so coveted by millions since late 2024 was officially pulled by an 11-year-old card collector in California.
The Pirates stated on social media that if the person who found the card was willing to return it to the club, they would get:
Two Pirates season tickets behind home plate for 30 years
A softball game at PNC Park for 30 with coaching from Pirates alumni
A spring training experience that would include a meet-and-greet with Skenes, two Skenes autographed jerseys, and the chance to take batting practice and warmups with the team.
Dunne upped the stakes, saying that whoever found the card and returned it to the team could watch a game in her suite with her at PNC Park.",n/a
sports,Sporting KC becomes 1st MLS team to win a game without recording a shot on goal,https://statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/05/sporting_kc_horizontal.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/maya-yoshida-own-goal-keeps-defendingchampion-galaxy-reeling-in-10-loss-to-sporting-kc,"Los Angeles Galaxy defender Maya Yoshida had the only score on Sunday night, but it was an own goal that led to a 1-0 victory for Sporting Kansas City. With the win, they made history, becoming the first MLS team to win a game without registering a shot on goal.
It was just the third win in 11 tries for Sporting Kansas City, this season, but their second in the last three games.
As for the Galaxy, they continued the worst start by a defending champion in league history. The Galaxy (0-8-3) are still looking for their first victory 11 matches into the season and even a 3-0-2 record in five previous matchups with Sporting KC (3-7-1) didn't help.
In the 13th minute, KC's Daniel Salloi sent in a cross on the ground, and it deflected off Maya Yoshida and into the net. There was no attacker near enough to the cross to threaten tapping it in, but Yoshida tried to make a defensive play and it went awry.
John Pulskamp had to make one save, and it came in the first half on the way to his second clean sheet in his 11th start of the season for Sporting KC. His save came just before halftime on a right-footed shot from the center of the box by John Nelson.
John McCarthy did not have a save for the Galaxy.
It was sweet revenge for Dejan Joveljic, who came to Sporting KC in the first cash-for-player trade in league history after helping the Galaxy win their sixth MLS Cup last season. He leads the team with five goals â€” all at home.
The Galaxy have missed Riqui Puig, who hasn't played since suffering a knee injury in the playoffs. And Joseph Paintsil and Gabriel Pec, who combined for 50 goals contributions in the championship run, have just four so far this season.
Sporting KC interim coach Kerry Zavagnin and the Galaxy's Greg Vanney were teammates on the US men's national team. The two coaches represented their current teams when the two clubs squared off in the conference final of the 2000 MLS Cup â€” won by the then-Kansas City Wizards, who went on to beat the Chicago Fire 1-0 in the championship match.
The Galaxy travel to play the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. Sporting KC travels to play the Portland Timbers on Saturday.

Our Andrew Marchand got the scoop: When the NFL announces its international games Tuesday, it is highly likely the Week 1 Friday prime-time game in Brazil will exclusively air on YouTube, the platform that eclipses every other video consumption/distribution network around the globe.
The game will be free for viewers. (Presumably, Google will be paying the NFL for the right to exclusively stream the game, as NBC did last year to get the Week 1 Brazil game on Peacock.) Last year's Week 1 game on Peacock had 14 million viewers, so imagine how many YouTube might be able to drive with virtually no barriers to viewing.
Why it's interesting to me: Industry observers have been waiting a long time for Google/YouTube to enter the exclusive live sports arena (and separate that from Google's deal with the NFL for rights to distribute the 'Sunday Ticket' package). You can understand why the NFL would be eager to do this â€” another deep-pocketed bidder for NFL rights only helps the league when those new rights come up for sale.
It is one thing for Caitlin Clark's WNBA games to top a million viewers during the regular season. It is another to top a million viewers for an otherwise anodyne Sunday afternoon preseason exhibition against a Brazilian national team with little to no name recognition among U.S. basketball fans. As noted in Richard Deitsch's coverage, that tops any NBA preseason game except two from LeBron James.
That made this game an incredible experiment for the preeminent sports media thesis: 'The Caitlin Clark effect is real.'
The main (if not only) reason to tune in last Sunday was to see Clark. Weird time slot. Not a ton of promotion. Anonymous opponent. And fans still sought it out. Now imagine a game in prime time against an opponent with an enthusiastic fan base of its own, like the defending champion New York Liberty or Angel Reese's Chicago Sky or A'ja Wilson's Las Vegas Aces.
It is an open question whether a network could air an Indiana Fever intra-team scrimmage and draw half a million people watching Clark. I'd take the over.
College football coaching legend Nick Saban (along with Texas Tech board chair Cody Campbell) would chair a new commission on college athletics that President Donald Trump is interested in forming.
Saban has been outspoken about the state of college sports, and Texas Tech has been at the forefront of tapping high-net-worth boosters to bolster its sports programs through new name, image and likeness rules (or lack thereof).

Will this commission have any actual formal power to create legislation? No. Will it be able to traverse the current gridlock to get Congress to agree on a national bill to adjust the college sports landscape? Again, almost certainly not. Will it add new complexity to an already-complicated college sports landscape? Surely!
I'm a branding enthusiast, so this week's reveal that Utah Hockey Club would be known as the 'Mammoth' was a notable development.
I'm a fan: Love that they went with the singular ('Mammoth') over the plural ('Mammoths') â€¦ love the logo (including, as others have noted, that subtle image of the state outline on the left side near the ear) â€¦ love the instant rallying cry, 'Tusks up!' (I am imagining a corresponding hand gesture that looks not unlike the way USC fans curl their index and middle fingers, although I'd flip it so that the fingertips are pointing toward your face.) I also love that the team was so open to including fan sentiment in the decision-making. Dan's branding grade: A-

Beijing published detailed rules on Wednesday for a ""technology board"" in the bond market to fund innovation amid intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry.
Tech companies can already issue such bonds, but financial companies have become eligible under the new mechanism. China's central bank will provide low-cost funding to support bond sales, while local governments will help share losses in the event of defaults.
It represents China's latest effort towards technology self-sufficiency as Washington steps up curbs against Chinese tech advancement. It is also a boon to private equity and venture capital firms suffering from slow initial public offerings at home.
Industrial Bank (601166.SS), opens new tab, Guolian Minsheng Securities Co (601456.SS), opens new tab and Wuxi Venture Capital Group are among more than a dozen companies announcing plans to issue sci-tech innovation bonds on Thursday.
People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said on Wednesday that nearly 100 companies are planning to sell such bonds to raise more than 300 billion yuan ($41.46 billion) in total, and he expects the list to grow further.
""Government support may help whet appetite of risk-averse bond investors,"" said Chen Yuting, analyst at Huafu Securities. ""A booming market would in turn stimulate tech innovation.""
Industrial Bank said it plans to raise 10 billion yuan via bond sales to fund innovative businesses and technology-related loans.
Brokerage Guolian Minsheng aims to issue up to 1.0 billion yuan of three-year bonds, mainly to finance tech-related investments.
Wuxi Venture Capital plans to sell 400 million yuan worth of three-year bonds. Proceeds will be used to swap existing equity investments and invest in new funds.
But there are signs proceeds from the bonds are used nowhere near technology or innovation in some cases.
Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group (XCMGP.UL) said on Thursday it plans to raise 1.0 billion yuan selling sci-tech innovation bonds to refinance bank loans.
Muyuan Foods (002714.SZ), opens new tab said it will use the 300 million yuan from planned bond sales to replenish working capital.

The effort to keep tabs on the chips, which drew bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers, aims to address reports of widespread smuggling of Nvidia's chips into China in violation of U.S. export control laws.
Nvidia's chips are a critical ingredient for creating AI systems such as chatbots, image generators and more specialized ones that can help craft biological weapons. Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have implemented progressively tighter export controls of Nvidia's chips to China.
But Reuters and other news organizations have documented how some of those chips have continued to flow , and Nvidia has publicly claimed it cannot track its products after they are sold.
U.S. Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois who once worked as a particle physicist, said the technology to track chips after they are sold is readily available, with much of it already built in to Nvidia's chips. Independent technical experts interviewed by Reuters agreed.
Foster, who successfully designed multiple computer chips during his scientific career, plans to introduce in coming weeks a bill that would direct U.S. regulators to come up with rules in two key areas: Tracking chips to ensure they are where they are authorized to be under export control licenses, and preventing those chips from booting up if they are not properly licensed under export controls.
Foster told Reuters that there are already credible reports - some of which have not been publicly disclosed - of chip smuggling occurring on a large scale.
""This is not an imaginary future problem,"" Foster told Reuters. ""It is a problem now, and at some point we're going to discover that the Chinese Communist Party, or their military, is busy designing weapons using large arrays of chips, or even just working on (artificial general intelligence), which is as immediate as nuclear technology.""
Nvidia declined to comment for this story.
Chip smuggling has taken on new urgency after the emergency of China's DeepSeek, whose AI systems posed a strong challenge to U.S. systems and were built with Nvidia chips that were prohibited for sale to China, according analyst firm SemiAnalysis. Prosecutors in Singapore have charged three Chinese nationals with fraud in a case that involved servers that may have contained Nvidia chips.
Though it has not been put into broad use, the technology to verify the location of chips already exists. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab Google already tracks the location of its in-house AI chips and others in its vast network of data centers for security purposes, according to two sources with direct knowledge of its operations.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
Foster's legislation would give the U.S. Department of Commerce six months to come up with regulations to require the technology.
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
Foster's bill has support from fellow Democrats such as Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on China. ""On-chip location verification is one creative solution we should explore to stop this smuggling,"" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement.
Republicans are also supportive, with Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the committee, telling Reuters that ""the Select Committee has strong bipartisan support for requiring companies like Nvidia to build location-tracking into their high-powered AI chips â€” and the technology to do it already exists.
The technology for verifying the location of chips would rely on the chips communicating with a secured computer server that would use the length of time it takes for the signal to reach the server to verify where chips are, a concept that relies on knowing that computer signals move at the speed of light.
Tim Fist, a former engineer and director of emerging technology policy at Washington think tank Institute for Progress, said such tracking would provide a general, country-level location for chips. But that is far more information than the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department responsible for enforcement of export controls, currently has.
""BIS has no idea which chips they should be targeting as a potential high priority to investigate once they've gone overseas,"" Fist said. With location verification, ""they now at least have bucketed the set of chips that are out there in the world into ones that are very likely to not have been smuggled and ones that warrant further investigation.""
Foster's second legislative goal of preventing AI chips from booting up if they are not properly licensed under U.S. export controls would be more technologically complex to implement than location verification, but he said the time has come to begin discussions for both efforts.
""We've gotten enough input that I think now we can have more detailed discussions with the actual chip and module providers to say, 'How would you actually implement this?'"" Foster told Reuters.",n/a

The agency announced Tuesday that notifications from the ""Safety Cloud"" system have now reached 900,000 drivers after 12 weeks of operation.
The program, paid for with a $135,000 federal grant, is installed in 233 State Police cruisers that patrol the state. The goal is to cut down on crashes involving first responders.
Police say their conventional lights and sirens don't always get the attention of drivers because cars are becoming more sound-proof and people are increasingly distracted by their phones.
""This innovative new technology will save lives,"" Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. ""It protects law enforcement and first responders when they're responding to emergencies on our roads, while also making it safer for nearby drivers and pedestrians.""
Safety Cloud alerts
When a trooper equipped with the new technology turns on their lights and sirens, a transponder is activated and a digital alert is sent to drivers in the area that shows up in the car's infotainment system or a navigation app like Waze.
The alert will pop up for drivers about 30 seconds before they encounter an emergency vehicle that's on the side of the road or approaching them.
""By providing automatic, advanced notice to drivers approach an emergency scene or a responding vehicle, we hope they can use good judgement and take action to move over, slow down, and pay extra attention to their surroundings,"" State Police Col. Geoffrey Noble said.
Last year, there were 42 incidents where a driver crashed into a stationary cruiser, State Police said.
State police are not the only agency in Massachusetts using the system made by HASS Alert. The I-Team reported that more than 90 other first responders and tow companies have deployed the technology.",n/a

Late Wednesday evening, Douglas County Sheriff's deputies pursued a stolen vehicle that ended with a crash at Centennial Airport. The incident is one of many examples of law enforcement across the state catching suspects with the help of Flock cameras, which take photos of license plates that drive by.
Douglas County Sheriff's Office
However, on Monday, the Denver City Council unanimously rejected a two-year extension of the Flock Safety Program, which placed license plate readers along roadways all across Denver. Members cited privacy concerns and potential opportunities for misuse as reasons.
To Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly, it should only be concerning for those breaking the law.
""I had the system up yesterday, about every five or 10 minutes, I had an alert that we had a problem,"" said Weekly.
CBS
The Sheriff calls the technology a game changer and is concerned with Denver's recent decision not to renew its contract to keep it.
""For Denver to stop using this technology, they are potentially affecting the entire rest of the Denver Metro area and our ability to solve crimes in our jurisdiction,"" said Weekly. ""It's a black hole for law enforcement. ""
Jurisdictions across the state are able to access the database to catch suspects wanted for crimes.
""Criminals talk. Not only do they talk about where law enforcement is going to chase you or be more aggressive in terms of our ability to capture you. But they also talk about who has license plate readers and who doesn't have license plate readers. They plan for that.""
Through this technology, law enforcement is alerted when a vehicle associated with a crime passes by a Flock camera. It uploads a photo of the vehicle and its license plate, as well as a pin on a map of where it was located.
CBS
The deputy who receives the alert would then have to access an additional state computer database to gain more information, such as who the vehicle is registered to.
""Nobody is accessing this information without a need to know. They need to have a case number or articulate their reasons for accessing the information, but again, they have to look at another database to determine what they actually have. That information is not available on the system itself,"" said Weekly.
In addition to general privacy concerns, Denver city council members fear the information could be shared with ICE. But, both the Denver Police Department and Sheriff Weekly say that's not happening.
""We have never given ICE any information, and they have never asked for it,"" Weekly explained. ""There's absolutely no facial recognition that is associated with this. This just searches plates and vehicle descriptions. That's it.""
A Denver city council member told CBS Colorado the city council is now working on an ordinance that will govern surveillance technology. The belief is that the mayor's office would like to continue using this type of technology, only under the protection of an ordinance.",n/a

The planned Disney waterfront resort will be located on Yas Island, a popular tourist destination that is home to other family-friendly attractions, including Warner Bros World Yas Island, SeaWorld Yas Island and Yas Waterworld Abu Dhabi.
The city of Abu Dhabi has a population of about 2.5 million, but Yas Island recorded more than 34 million visits in 2023, a 38% rise compared to the year before, Miral has said.
'We've always been interested in this part of the world - to bring our Disney stories to new, younger fans,' Disney's Experiences unit Chairman Josh D'Amaro told Reuters, adding, 'Abu Dhabi was an ideal location for us.'
Miral, the Abu Dhabi-based leisure and entertainment group responsible for developing Yas Island, will finance, build and operate the resort. The creative and technical professionals who design Disney's theme parks, known as Imagineers, will lead creative design and provide operational oversight.
The U.S. entertainment company will earn royalties based on the park's revenue, according to a regulatory filing.
The Disney park ""will be authentically Disney and distinctly Emirati - an oasis of extraordinary Disney entertainment that is at the crossroads of the world,' Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement on Wednesday.
Abu Dhabi is known for its oil wealth, though last year it announced plans to invest more than $10 billion in infrastructure to grow its tourism business. The international airport in UAE's commercial hub Dubai aims to boost its capacity to accommodate 120 million passengers a year by 2026.
Disney did not announce the opening date for the new park, though D'Amaro said a project of this scale could take a year or two to design, and another four to six years to build.
Once complete, the resort will offer Disney-themed attractions, dining and retail experiences, in a way that blends the Burbank entertainment company's storytelling and Abu Dhabi's heritage, D'Amaro said.

The Abu Dhabi park, Disney's first since Shanghai Disneyland opened in 2016, represents a continuation of the company's plans to 'turbocharge' its Experiences unit, which includes its six global theme park resorts, a cruise ship line and a family resort in Hawaii.
In 2023, Disney announced it would commit $60 billion over a decade to double the size of its Disney cruise ship fleet and invest in its theme parks. It also took a minority stake in Epic Games, creator of the online game Fortnite.
Miral initially approached Disney to talk about their plans for creating a tourism hub in Abu Dhabi, said D'Amaro. That conversation led Disney executives to visit the prospective theme park site last September.
'We saw where our potential park might go, and had some serious conversations about what this could mean to our 'turbocharging',' D'Amaro said.
After a return trip to the region in February, D'Amaro said the parties entered into serious discussions that culminated in a deal. The amount of Miral's investment was not disclosed.
Miral Group CEO Mohamed Abdalla Al Zaabi issued a statement hailing the addition of a Disney theme park to Yas Island as a 'historic milestone' in the company's efforts to build the island into a global entertainment destination.",n/a

Leaders from across the country and other nations are here this week discussing ways to improve nighttime entertainment options.
Edward Grant, with the City of Dallas, was one of those officials and experts in town. He's introducing the concept of noctourism, which is the creation of more after-hours festivals and entertainment to bring in more money from people from across the region and state.
""They're there for that event, but then they're spending money at your restaurants, they're spending money at your hotels to stay overnight, they're spending money on transportation,"" Grant said.
But increasing crowds at night can also create safety concerns.
""Your potential for something to happen grows, and that's the risk part of it, but it's how we plan, prevent and respond to it that makes a difference,"" Grant said.
Sacramento's nighttime economy manager, Tina Lee-Vogt, says the city is already working to expand evening entertainment options and safety.
""I think, sometimes, that we focus so much on day tourism that we forget about the other 9-5,"" Lee-Vogt said.
Last month, Sacramento created new permits that allow dancing, DJs and live music in places like wine bars, coffee shops and breweries.
The city is also considering allowing people to drink alcohol in special zones outside bars and restaurants.
""I think it's a great idea and it gives the ability to start socializing and to really not worry about pounding that drink as quickly as they normally would,"" Lee-Vogt said.
State lawmakers are also considering a bill that would allow serving alcohol for two extra hours, extending the last call to 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.",n/a

'I feel wonderful,' he told Entertainment Tonight in a recent interview. 'I pray every night before we go on that we can be entertaining and uplifting to the people who are there.'
But on Tuesday, Mr. Robinson's victory lap was upended when four women who had worked as housekeepers for him filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault, claiming in the suit that he abused them dozens of times over many years.
The suit, filed in Los Angeles, identifies the women only as Jane Does 1 through 4. They each accuse Mr. Robinson of raping them repeatedly while they were employed cleaning his home in Chatsworth, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, as well as in his other homes in Ventura County, Calif., and Las Vegas.",n/a

As those institutions and supporting businesses such as restaurants expand, so do the number of visitors to downtown Aurora, the city said.
The new portal provides key data points on the city's performing arts spaces and overall economic growth, with the goal of discerning a pattern to measure the economic value and impact of the arts community in Aurora, the city said.

The information in the portal tracks attendance figures, subscription rates, and several events at specific Aurora entertainment venues.
These figures are compared to the city's annual food and beverage tax revenue, parking revenue, and general sales tax revenue.
""What has been achieved over the past 15 years in downtown Aurora exemplifies the best of what can happen when arts organizations partner with a municipality to mutually foster the regrowth of a historic downtown. Bringing arts patrons to not only see shows, but also to eat, shop, learn, and live downtown has brought about significant change,"" Tim Rater, President and CEO of the Aurora Civic Center Authority, said in a news release. ""While we've always perceived that to be true, the City's revenue statistics validate those assumptions that live entertainment has been one of the major engines that are driving the rebirth of downtown Aurora.""

'I will also point out as well, when he's talking about Hollywood and films, I think he's using that as a catch-all to describe entertainment writ large, because there's a lot of TV shows. And let's be real, most of us are watching TV shows, we're not going to the theater at all. Also too, I mean when you look at some of the things that were nominated for the Oscars, I know this feels like ages ago but they were bizarre. I'm like, yeah we don't need more of that, we can tax those films. But I think he's talking about entertainment more broadly. And 'Suits' famously, I don't know I've been going down a Meghan Markle rabbit hole for quite some time and she talks a lot about how she lived in Toronto for a decade and that's been a long-standing thing. So it's not just the film it's all the tv shows too. And I think that's what he's getting at.'
