politics,Peak absurdity on campaign finance reform heads to the Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BDLVJO2EPIVUB4YHMZLMVNW464.JPG&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/13/campaign-finance-reform-first-amendment,"Developments in recent decades reflect diminished respect for the First Amendment. These include campus speech codes, political pressure for censorship on social media platforms, and a society-wide 'cancel culture' that inspires self-censorship lest 'harmful' speech 'trigger' offended hearers.
The most serious speech-regulation began half a century ago, under the antiseptic rubric of 'campaign finance reform.' On Wednesday, the Supreme Court can begin removing another shackle reformers have clamped on political speech. The court will consider taking a case about whether the First Amendment is violated by limits on what political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates' campaigns.
How did such an anodyne practice become problematic? This is how:
In the 1970s, reformers, using the Watergate scandals as a pretext, restricted campaign giving and spending. This was supposedly to prevent 'corruption' — quid pro quo transactions — or the appearance thereof.
Reformers regulated 'hard' money given to particular candidates; then 'soft' money, given to parties for organizing and advocacy. Next, they targeted independent groups' 'express advocacy' of the election or defeat of identifiable candidates. Reformers also restricted such groups' advocacy for or against issues clearly identified with particular candidates.
On Wednesday, peak absurdity reaches the Supreme Court. It must decide whether a compelling government interest is served by limiting 'coordination' between parties and their candidates. Lest the parties corrupt their own nominees?
Actual quid pro quo corruption involving donors is rare. Abundant research confirms what common sense suggests: Political contributions move to politicians' issue positions, not the other way around. Teachers unions generally support Democrats for the same reason opponents of gun restrictions generally support Republicans: the parties' preexisting beliefs.
All laws regulating political competition involve government stipulating the permissible quantity of speech about the government's composition. All campaign finance laws are written by members of the political class — by incumbent legislators. Such laws require a skeptical squint: look for evidence of class interest.
It is easy to see: Incumbency confers enormous communication advantages; challengers must spend a lot to match this. So, limits on political giving and spending protect incumbents.
For modern mugwumps bent on removing the politics from politics, the maddening 'problem' is that people affected by government keep trying to affect the government's composition. The reformers — including exhorting and a self-interested media — fret about the 'problem' of 'too much money' in politics. The complaint necessarily is that there is too much political speech, because all campaign spending is to fund, directly or indirectly, the dissemination of political advocacy to large constituencies.
How much, and by what metric, is there 'too much' money in politics? In the 2023-2024 election cycle, candidates for federal offices (president, House, Senate) spent a total of $5.5 billion. To support them, political parties spent $2.6 billion, and political action committees spent $15.5 billion. (Reformers produced the dominance of PACs with regulations that diverted political contributions away from parties.) This $23.6 billion is less than the $29.2 billion of advertising spending in the same 24 months by just two U.S. companies, Procter & Gamble ($17.6 billion) and PepsiCo ($11.6 billion).
For reformers, another 'problem' is too much political participation: Political contributions are how millions of citizens participate. And by supporting the rationing of political speech, the media enhance the dominance of their unregulated speech.
Campaign 'reforms' threaten the core speech protected by the First Amendment: political discourse. Today, many progressive intellectuals have decided the First Amendment is a 'loophole' that endangers their agenda of regulating everything, speech emphatically included. Public support for free speech might be weaker now than at any time since the First Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1791.
In 2014, 54 senators, all from the Democratic caucus, voted to weaken the Bill of Rights' protections by amending the First Amendment to permit people like them to ration speech about people like them. They thereby acknowledged that the amendment's clear text ('Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech') forbids the campaign reformers' desires.
Today's political hygienists still have a metastasizing agenda for government regulation of the quantity of campaign speech. (And the content of it: avoid 'express advocacy.' And the timing of it: not too close to an election.) The result is a rococo regime of speech restrictions, and hairsplitting exemptions therefrom.
Beginning Wednesday, the court can reaffirm the First Amendment's crystalline simplicity, the wisdom of which is as self-evident as this: No compelling government interest is served by limiting the ability of parties to coordinate with their candidates' political speech.",
politics,MSNBC anchor asks panel if political violence is a result of the 'will of the people' being ignored or just part of life,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/AymanMohyeldin.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-anchor-asks-panel-political-violence-result-will-people-being-ignored-just-part-life,"MSNBC anchor Ayman Mohyeldin asked on Sunday whether ""lone wolves"" engaged in political violence can be blamed on the current failure of the political system to hear their concerns.
Over the weekend, a panel on MSNBC discussed the recent wave of political violence over the past decade, ranging from the shooting at the congressional Republicans' baseball practice and the attempts on Donald Trump's life to the more recent murders of two Israeli Embassy workers and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.
The panel's conversation was spurred by the killing of former Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as the related shootings of State Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. The suspect in these attacks is Vance Luther Boelter, who was captured after a two-day manhunt, and has since been charged with two counts of stalking, two counts of murder and two counts of firearm-related crimes in federal court.
During the panel, Mohyeldin turned to former New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and asked whether the recent trend of political violence can be blamed on the system for failing to hear voters' concerns.
""Do you believe there's a correlation between how efficiently our democracy and our government runs and the risk of political violence?"" Mohyeldin asked. ""That when people out there who feel a sense of desperation — and by no means is this a justification, but I'm thinking of Luigi Mangione, who killed in cold blood the CEO of a healthcare company — Do you believe when people don't have any political outlets, when the government or the system is not representative of the will of the people, these lone wolves, these self-radicalized people then resort to this type of violence? Or do you believe this type of violence will always exist in our society, no matter how efficiently our system of governance works?""
""There has always been, through history, a correlation to the political moment and whether society is serving people or not,"" the former mayor answered, warning that even so, ""there's never a justification for political violence.""
De Blasio argued that while there have been times of relative peace, ""the '60s was a time of great political violence, these last years as well, where the level of political conflict intensified and, of course, where there were those voices giving a permission structure.""
After citing past examples of violence by both state and non-state actors in the past, the former mayor suggested, ""I think it's also fair to say that when the public in general feels that society is serving them, when there's a sense of belonging, when there's a sense of people being included and respected, it takes the temperature down, it gives less oxygen for fringe elements or violent elements to exist. And I think we can get back there.""
He then suggested that the rise of Trump is at least partially to blame for recent political violence.
""But it will take, bluntly, defeating Trumpism and taking away that permission structure that it's created, and showing people that there can be a path to a society that's inclusive once again,"" De Blasio said.",
politics,"As the Army celebrates its 250th birthday, officials say the military's apolitical nature is at risk","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-2025-06-10t111801z-1229650419-rc2gzea7wrtb-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-parade.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://us.cnn.com/2025/06/14/politics/army-us-politicization,"As the US Army prepares for its 250th birthday celebration with a major parade of military hardware in Washington, DC, which just happens to coincide with President Donald Trump's birthday, former officials are growing increasingly concerned about how the military is being pulled into the political arena, multiple former and current officials told CNN.
The parade, which will feature several million pounds of military hardware including tanks, Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, and culminate in a speech from Trump, comes at a tense moment. This week, roughly 4,000 National Guardsmen were mobilized in Los Angeles, along with a full battalion of US Marines in response to civil unrest. Thousands of National Guardsmen have also been mobilized in Texas. And on Tuesday, uniformed US soldiers were seen on-camera cheering the president as he delivered a political speech at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, reminiscent of those he delivered on the campaign trail – an event which serves as a microcosm of the concerns around a larger trend of the politicization of the military.
Current and former military officials told CNN that the event at Fort Bragg is being viewed within some corners of the Army as a public relations fail, since the military has strict regulations regarding political activity and is typically hyper-sensitive to any perception it is taking a political stance.
Multiple officials said the Army had little control over the event; once the president is involved, they said, the White House takes over. And a defense official with direct knowledge of the event emphasized it was not the Army's intention for the troops to appear political. Sometimes, they said, the situation is out of their hands.
'I would say I never want to see a political piece of paraphernalia on a military installation, period,' the official said, adding that it's 'not the military that's trying to be political, it's people trying to use the military – which tends to poll very positively – for political gain.'
Current and former officials speaking to CNN had varied levels of concern regarding the trajectory the military is on in regard to being seen as political. Some, for example, maintained that Saturday's parade was about celebrating the Army, while others acknowledged heartburn among leaders that while the Army may see it as celebrating the service, the public could associate the parade, which has been a goal of Trump's since his first term, with a celebration of his presidency.
One current defense official remarked that it's not so much a matter of reminding soldiers what their 'left and right limits' are with political activity, because 'we don't know what the left and right limits even are, anymore.'
'The actions that were once rightfully criticized or rightfully labeled as partisan activity, or not appropriate, are now celebrated,' the official said.
The official also pointed to multiple instances in the Biden administration and under Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that they felt were political, emphasizing that the issue of politicizing the military has been building for years.
Indeed, there have been a number of political events or social media posts over the last several years involving the military and service members that have drawn criticism.
In 2022, President Joe Biden was criticized for having two Marines flank him during a speech in Philadelphia, in which he spoke about the threats to 'equality and democracy' posed by former President Donald Trump. Various political hopefuls have released campaign imagery and videos that appear to violate DOD policy. In 2020, the Army Reserve said it would discipline the supervisor of two Army Reserve soldiers who appeared in uniform during a Democratic National Convention video.
Trump's address at Fort Bragg this week was far from the first time a political leader from any party has delivered a speech to or around US service members, but many officials who spoke to CNN were struck by the outwardly partisan behavior of many of the soldiers on-camera behind Trump.
The Pentagon has strict regulations for political activity in uniform, stating that active-duty service members 'will not engage in partisan political activities and all military personnel will avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DOD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause.'
On Tuesday, the soldiers at Fort Bragg booed and cheered along with Trump's remarks, booing the media, former President Joe Biden, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Social media posts from the event on Tuesday viewed by CNN also showed photos of 'Make America Great Again' hats and necklaces being sold by vendors, and in some photos, soldiers donned the gear while in uniform.
The same official said the soldiers, many of them young and relatively inexperienced, were caught up in the moment – enjoying the day of celebration and excited to be so close to the commander in chief – and that there were people in the crowd trying to get the soldiers to cheer at certain moments of Trump's speech.
Col. Mary Ricks, spokeswoman for the 18th Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, said in a statement that the event 'was planned in cooperation with America 250, a nonpartisan organization created to support the U.S. Semi quincentennial Commission established by Congress in 2016.'
'The Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,' Ricks said.
Still, current and former officials voiced concern that the event could contribute to damaging public trust in the military as an institution, which is crucial to military leaders; it feeds into their ability to recruit new service members, and to get funding for various efforts and projects.
'It's a slippery slope when you use very aggressive rhetoric against a political opponent and use the backdrop of military personnel …. using them as a validation for your political agenda, that's where people get upset,' a former senior Defense Department official said.
Trump's speech at Fort Bragg came just a couple of weeks after he delivered the commencement address at the US Military Academy at West Point, wearing a bright red MAGA hat amid the sea of grey and white West Point uniforms. One recently retired Army general officer told CNN that the West Point and Fort Bragg addresses show 'a complete disregard for the centuries old civ-mil non-partisan interaction with the military.'
The former senior DOD official told CNN that while Trump's language at Fort Bragg was more aggressive against his political opponents than other presidents have done, political leaders have 'always pushed their agendas in front of the troops.'
'It always made us a little anxious,' the official said, 'but they all do it.'
'Should the Army put out something that says hey, we maintain order and discipline, and in according with regulation X, we refrain from blah blah blah? Yeah,' a defense official said. 'We should. But we aren't going to.'",

""It is not who we are""
""I'm horrified to hear about the shootings in Minnesota. Lawmakers and their loved ones getting shot for their beliefs is yet another sickening act of political violence in a country where it's become all too common. I'm holding the family of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in my heart and praying for the full recovery of Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. This is not normal. It is not who we are as Americans, and we must all condemn political violence in the strongest possible terms,"" Healey said in a prepared statement.
Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings early Saturday morning.

Many in Massachusetts expressed their outrage over the shootings.
""This is political violence, pure and simple, and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by every leader in this country. America's founders envisioned a country where we address our differences through debate, not violence. We must continue to use our voices to keep advocating for the country we dream to be, even as acts of political violence seem more common,"" said Massachusetts Senate President Karen E. Spilka.
Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Steve Kerrigan called the shootings ""horrific.""
""I join leaders of both parties in stating, once and for all, that acts of politically motivated violence have no place in America,"" Kerrigan said.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald J. Mariano said he was ""appalled and heartbroken"" by the shootings.
""Political violence of any kind has no place in America, nor does the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that can often incite that violence. This is not the America that we want for ourselves and for future generations. We must all strive for something better,"" Mariano said.",

Melissa Hortman and her husband. A second shooting wounded Democratic Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.
Hortman and her husband were shot and killed overnight in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called a politically motivated shooting. Authorities said the suspect dressed in a manner to appear as a police officer and fatally shot them in their home before continuing to Hoffman's home, where they shot him and his wife, wounding them. A manhunt is underway for the suspect.

The shootings have sent shock and sadness through the political community.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis released a statement condemning the shootings, saying,
""Colorado stands with Minnesota, and our deepest sympathies go out to those impacted by what appears to be politically motivated attacks. Make no mistake, politically motivated violence, assassinations, and attempts on the lives of elected officials are not the America we know, hold dear, and love. We must continue to reject the divisive politics and rhetoric that have become too prevalent in our country. Those involved in this heinous crime should never see the light of day again, be fully prosecuted under the law, and Colorado is ready to offer any assistance to our friends in Minnesota.""
He and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt also released a joint statement from the bipartisan National Governors Association:
""We are deeply saddened by the targeted political shootings that took place in Minnesota. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and the people of Minnesota.
As Chair and Vice Chair of the National Governors Association, we condemn political violence in all forms. These attacks are not just assaults on individuals; they are attacks on our communities and the very foundation of our democracy. Public servants should never fear for their lives for serving our communities.
We stand united in urging federal, state, and local officials to swiftly investigate and bring those responsible to justice. We also call on all Americans to reject political hatred and violence, and to recommit to the values of civility, respect, and peaceful democratic discourse.
Now more than ever, we must come together as one nation to ensure that our public square remains a place of debate, not danger.""
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett asserted, ""There is no place for political violence in a democracy,"" and thanked law enforcement for their immediate response.
Colorado House Republican leaders called the shootings an ""unconscionable act of violence"" and ""an attack on democracy itself"" and offered condolences to Minnesotans and the families and friends of the victims.
Minority Leader Rose Pugliese said, ""There is absolutely no justification for targeted attacks on elected officials—or anyone—based on their political beliefs. Our nation was built on civil discourse and the peaceful exchange of ideas, not horrific acts of violence. We are keeping the families of Rep. Hortman and Senator Hoffman in our prayers.""
""Those who resort to political violence betray the very foundation of this country,"" said Caucus Chair Anthony Hartsook. ""While details continue to emerge, early reports make it clear that these lawmakers were targeted. That cannot be tolerated or ignored.""
President Trump also issued a statement Saturday promising that the suspect will be brought to justice.
""I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers. Our Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the FBI, are investigating the situation, and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!""",
politics,"What motivated the Minnesota lawmaker shooting suspect is unclear, so are his politics",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/walz-press-conference.png,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-motivated-minnesota-lawmaker-shooting-suspect-unclear-so-his-politics,"Gov. Tim Walz has condemned the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband as politically motivated, but questions remain about the suspect's political affiliation.
The Democrat Minnesota governor immediately denounced what he said ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination,"" following the attacks Saturday morning.
Vance Luther Boelter, 57, is charged with killing Hortman and her husband, Mark, and shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in separate incidents early Saturday morning.
Lawmakers from Minnesota and across the United States have since joined Walz in condemning the violent attacks. Politicians and authorities have been clear that Saturday's attack was politically motivated, but they have been less clear about the suspect's political preferences.
U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said Monday that Boelter's primary motive was ""to go out and murder people"" as authorities announced the suspect's capture on Monday after a two-day manhunt.
""Now, they were all elected officials,"" Thompson said. ""They were all Democrats. Beyond that, I think it's just way too speculative for anyone that has reviewed these materials to know and to say what was motivating him in terms of ideology or specific issues.""
Boelter now faces federal charges after officials arrested him in Sibley County on Sunday night. He is charged with two counts of stalking, two counts of murder and two counts of firearm-related crimes. Boelter is also facing second-degree murder charges filed in Hennepin County.
""Political violence has no place in this country,"" Alvin M. Winston, FBI Minneapolis special agent, said during a press conference on Monday.
While Thompson said it was too early to identify specific political motivation, he said, ""This was a political assassination.""
""It's only the most recent example of violent political extremism in this country,"" Thompson added, in light of two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump last year, the attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband at their home in San Francisco in 2022, and the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., at the annual Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, to name a few.
Records reveal Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota, where voters don't list party affiliation.
Boelter was previously appointed to Minnesota's Workforce Development Board by two governors, according to Fox 9.
The suspect was reportedly appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and then re-appointed by Walz in 2019 as a private sector representative to the council. He previously served on the same board as Hoffman before his term expired in 2023.
Friends and former colleagues interviewed by the Associated Press described Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and attended Trump rallies.
Paul Shroeder, who has known Boelter for years, told AP, ""He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,"" and added, ""It seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.""
A Fox News search found no results for individual contributions to federally registered political committees.
According to Boelter's LinkedIn page, he has a purported extensive security background, including as CEO of Red Lion Group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is also listed as the director of Praetorian Guard Security Services, a security firm his wife reportedly filed to create, according to the company's website.
Several AK-47-style firearms were recovered from Boelter's vehicle during the investigation, along with a pile of ""No Kings"" flyers, reflecting anti-Trump administration protests that erupted across the country this weekend.
Walz had planned to speak at a ""No Kings"" rally in St. Paul on Saturday before the assassination.
Authorities also found a manifesto that listed the names and addresses of other public officials. About 70 names were found in the manifesto, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Officials said the list also included the names of pro-abortion politicians, abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities.
""There were some abortion-rights supporters, I believe, on the list. But again, there was dozens and dozens and dozens of names on, you know, hundreds of pages of documents that were recovered with his writings on them,"" Thompson said.
Boelter's roommate told the New York Post that he had conservative political views but rarely talked about politics and didn't seem overtly political.
""He was a Trump supporter. He voted for Trump. He liked Trump. I like Trump,"" his lifelong friend, David Carlson, said. ""He didn't like abortion.""
Carlson told the New York Times that Boelter had been experiencing financial and mental health challenges, and that Bolter ""just gave up on life for some reason.""
According to the Wall Street Journal, Carlson woke up on Saturday to a text from Boelter that he was ""going to be gone for a while"" and ""may be dead shortly.""
""I thought he was going to do self-harm,"" Carlson said. ""I didn't think he was going to do anything like this.""
Walz continued to denounce the violence during a press conference Monday.
""A moment in this country where we watched violence erupt. This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences.""
And Walz added in a statement that we ""cannot become numb to this violence,"" adding we are a ""deeply divided nation.""
Walz's office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital inquiry.",

Dellimore's voice is familiar to many who drive or take the train to work. He started at Newsradio in 1983, back when WBBM Newsradio was upstairs from Channel 2 at the old CBS Chicago broadcast center at 630 N. McClurg Ct. in Streeterville.
Dellimore became political editor at WBBM Newsradio in 2001 — succeeding the legendary Bob Crawford, who had held the post since the station went all-news in 1968. As political editor, Dellimore covered numerous campaigns, controversies, and national political conventions, hosted the ""At Issue"" public affairs show.
Beyond politics, Dellimore also covered the tragic crash of American Eagle Flight 4184 in Roselawn, Indiana on a blustery Halloween in 1994, and a west suburban woman's long and ultimately successful quest from a lung transplant.
Dellimore is retiring this month.
During his 42-year career, he said the one story that crystallized Chicago's politics is former Mayor Harold Washington's candidacy the same year Dellimore started at WBBM Newsradio.
""Washington was becoming a serious candidate for mayor, and I got to see the rise,"" he said, ""and I wasn't a political reporter then, but any reporter got to see the rise of the first African American mayor.""
Dellimore also noted that he got to cover the rise of Barack Obama from Illinois state senator and University of Chicago Law School lecturer to U.S. Senator — and ultimately to president in 2008, ""every step of the way through different elections.""
""That has been a real excitement in this career,"" he said.
Dellimore also expressed his thoughts on watching how the Chicago City Council evolved over the years.
""It wasn't just the Council Wars, it's been a real change to see a City Council that at times has been accused of being a rubber stamp, become a deliberative body, to get to know the aldermen. This is a very different city from a lot where you don't really know your City Council members. Here, they have real power, and it's been fun to cover that,"" he said.
Another thing Dellimore noticed during his career was the change in news media, and in particular the coverage of Chicago politics.
""At one point, it was burgeoning. The City Hall press room was packed with people,"" he said. ""Now there aren't that many of us, but it's a tight-knit group.""
On Tuesday, the Chicago Mayor's office honored Dellimore after he covered his final news conference with Mayor Brandon Johnson.

politics,Taking on Israel's greatest foe has banished Netanyahu's political troubles in an instant,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2219687692.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://us.cnn.com/2025/06/17/middleeast/israel-iran-netanyahu-motivation-intl-latam,"Benjamin Netanyahu is once again firmly in control of Israeli politics.
The country's longest-serving prime minister has pulled himself back from the abyss with what appears to be a wildly successful opening to a military campaign against Iran.
'Bibi had his Churchill moment,' said one Israeli official from within the coalition, using the prime minister's nickname.
One day before launching what Israel dubbed Operation Rising Lion, Netanyahu's government had faced a confidence vote from the opposition.
Two of the ultra-Orthodox parties threatened to vote against the government in what would have put major pressure on Netanyahu. But he survived the vote – with quite some margin.
Twenty-four hours later, Israel began attacking Iran. In one instant, Netanyahu's political problems were swept away. No more ultra-Orthodox parties complaining about the military draft or far-right parties shouting about praying in the al-Aqsa compound.
'The cards are in his hands. If they weren't a week ago, they are now,' said the official.
The weekly political protests – first over the judicial reform, then over the war in Gaza – that have dogged Netanyahu for much of his current term quickly vanished, with orders from Israel's Homefront Command forbidding large gatherings of people. Netanyahu's testimony in his trial on charges of corruption is on hold and out of the headlines. The stories of the hostages still held in Gaza for more than 600 days of war are no longer front-page news.
Netanyahu is well aware of the political consequences of such a successful military operation, according to an Israeli source in the prime minister's orbit, though the source insists it's not his focus right now
'If we are doing something good for Israel, it's good to us,' the source said. 'It's good for you electorally, it's good for you with the voters … He will harvest this in the future.'
The source also pointed out the complete reversal of the political opposition from attacking Netanyahu to supporting him.
'This time, we have unity almost all over the Knesset, except from the Arab parties, and we have unity in the people,' said the source.
Iran has been at the center of Netanyahu's identity for nearly his entire political career. His time as Israel's longest-serving leader is replete with warnings about Iran. Some have been borderline cartoonish, like when he held up a drawing of a bomb to warn of Tehran's advancing nuclear program at the United Nations General Assembly in 2012. He has since returned to the same podium – and many others – to lecture the world repeatedly about the intent of the Ayatollahs.
Israel's existential fear wasn't a single one of its adversaries. It was all of them combined: an overwhelming attack from Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and the Shiite proxies in Syria and Iraq. This was Israel's nightmare scenario that Hamas tried to instigate with its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
It quickly became evident that each entity had its own interests.
Hezbollah began launching attacks against Israel on October 8, but it was far from the massive barrages which worried the military's leadership. Iran launched two retaliatory attacks against Israel last year in April and October. The Houthis began firing drones and ballistic missiles at Israel from Yemen, but never more than one or two at a time.
Over 20 months of war, Israel was able to defang each of its adversaries. Hamas is a shell of its former self, Hezbollah has been shattered, and the Houthis don't have the arsenal to pose a major threat.
'They've kind of broken down the axis into the more manageable parts,' former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro told CNN.
That allowed Israel to turn its focus to Iran without fear of massive retaliation from another front. From Netanyahu's political perspective, the risk was far lower, especially since Israel's spy agency has treated Iran like its playground for years.
'At his age, he has much less of a political career left to lose,' Shapiro said. 'So it's easier to throw the caution that held him back in the past to the wind, especially to reach for a career-defining goal.'
But whether the military campaign against Iran buoys Netanyahu's long-sinking polling numbers is not a foregone conclusion, according to Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israeli Democracy Institute.

Polling in recent months has repeatedly shown Netanyahu far behind political rival Naftali Bennett. Crucially, it has indicated he would fall far short of being able to build a coalition with his current political partners, ousting him from leadership.
The Iran operation may not ultimately deliver the political salvation Netanyahu wants, Plesner said, because it is an issue with broad agreement from the left and the right.
'It's a tremendous consensus around the need for Israel to do the utmost to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear,' Plesner told CNN. 'It's not an issue that there was an ideological debate about.'
Israel is also mired in the ongoing war in Gaza with no clear exit and lacking a comprehensive day-after plan. A second war, even with far more tangible accomplishments, presents another risk to Netanyahu if it drags on.
'The ability of the government to translate the military successes into an advantageous diplomatic outcome is yet to be determined,' said Plesner.",
politics,ASRA NOMANI: The $2.1 billion machine behind 'spontaneous' anti-Trump protests,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/trump-cecot-protest2025.png,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/asra-nomani-2-1-billion-machine-behind-spontaneous-anti-trump-protests,"Early Tuesday evening, as National Guard troops faced off against protesters and rioters on the streets of Los Angeles, powerful teachers' union president Randi Weingarten hosted a virtual town hall with Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.and two leading political operatives in Democratic Party politics, Leah Greenberg, founder of a political nonprofit, Indivisible, and Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of another political nonprofit, National Action Network.
Greenberg hailed an upcoming wave of protests this Saturday — set to sweep through even ""really red areas of the country,"" marked with mostly Republican voters — as a stand against President Donald Trump. Throughout the call, Weingarten beamed, excited. Sharpton phoned in his enthusiasm about people with ""different political beliefs"" uniting. They touted Saturday's campaign as the ""#NoKings"" protest.
But what they didn't detail is the massive network of Democratic organizations funding and orchestrating this supposedly spontaneous uprising.
As editor-in-chief of the Pearl Project, a nonprofit journalism initiative I founded in honor of my friend and colleague, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, I've spent the past two decades investigating how ideology, identity politics, and sectarian hatred can turn violent. Radicalized Pakistani militants brutally murdered Danny after kidnapping him in 2002 on the streets of Karachi, Pakistan, and demonizing him as an American, a Jew and a grandson of Israel. I have warned about an unholy alliance between far-left radicalism and Islamist extremism, and it has now come home to the streets of the United States.
In my 2023 book, ""Woke Army,"" I documented how this alliance has morphed into a new threat inside our institutions, from higher education to politics — weaponizing identity and cause-based activism, like immigration, to undermine civil society.
The #NoKings protest is the latest front in this propaganda war.
According to new research by the Pearl Project, the #NoKings protest is being organized by an estimated 198 groups, all of which are aligned with the Democratic Party and many of which claim tax-exempt, ""nonpartisan"" nonprofit status. Collectively, these groups take in $2.1 billion in annual revenues.
Here is the breakdown of 198 ""partners"" listed in the official publicity material for the financial and political machine behind #NoKings:
I've made the research public in an online database that I am working on making into a user-friendly digital encyclopedia for the protest industry, so everyone from parents to police officers can understand the organizations fomenting chaos from our streets to our campuses.
I've been tracking the anti-Trump protesters since 2017 when #Resistance became the buzzword for activists like Palestinian American Linda Sarsour, leading the Women's March against Trump. Since Trump's inauguration this past January, I've investigated the companies behind the #TeslaTakedown, #HandsOff and #MayDay protests that have marked ""resistance 2.0"" over the past several months against the Trump administration.
The groups include several organizations, including Jewish Voice for Peace and Sarsour's MPower Change Action Fund, that represent the unholy alliance of Islamist sympathizers and leftists who have fueled fiery protests against the existence of the state of Israel, following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israelis. I've identified 1,500 groups in the anti-semitism protest industry.
Most certainly, this week's protests and the protests coming up are not an organic, citizen-led ""resistance.""
This is top-down political warfare, branded as grassroots activism but actually an AstroTurf political operation.
The anti-Trump protest industry is very broad, and these are some additional findings:
These organizations are not your local knitting club. They are professional protest organizers.
For the #NoKings protest, the ""Indivisible Digital Asset Management"" team has assembled an online digital ""brand folder"" with 29 brand ""assets"" in a folder marked ""Flyers, Rally Signs, & Printed Materials,"" 25 ""assets"" in a ""Graphics"" folder, 8 ""Templates,"" two logos, a brand palette of four vibrant branding colors, easy-to-read fonts and engaging ""design elements.""
Indivisible also created a 12-page digital ""NO KINGS Toolkit for Hosts,"" shared on Google Docs, with ""messaging,"" ""NO KINGS Mobilization Tactics,"" ""sample event agenda"" and tips on ""getting media attention."" Its tips noted: ""Identify at least 1 group member to be responsible for firing up the crowd…"" I'm including various parts of this orchestrated protest in an online protest industry folder.
Some of the sample messages for signs: ""NO KINGS IN AMERICA!,"" ""Stop the Shakedown!"" and ""We are Not For Sale!"" They will be repeated across the country.
The templates have been leveraged to now create a cookie-cutter production of graphics on social media orchestrated around the hashtag #NoKings.
Importantly, just as the mainstream media examines the dynamics of ""white supremacy,"" ""fascism"" and ""MAGA,"" we must not be naïve about the ideological undercurrents driving ""progressive"" protests to violence.
A while back, The New York Times exposed a wealthy tech tycoon, Neville Roy Singham, for funding and promoting Chinese Communist Party propaganda, and he has been tied to funding many of the groups – Party for Socialism and Liberation, the People's Forum, the Answer Coalition and CodePink — engaged in the most confrontational protests in recent days and months against Israel and the United States. These groups are proudly self-described socialist organizations stoking discontent to push an anti-capitalist, anti-American agenda.
While Singham doesn't yet appear to have his fingerprints directly on the #NoKings protest, the ideological DNA is the same.
The #NoKings protest is likely to be the next playing field for the anti-ICE, anti-Trump agitators. Indeed, #ResistTrump, one of the ""partners"" for Saturday's protests, promotes an ""orientation"" slide deck that itemizes the elements of ""expressing political dissent"" from ""voting to violence."" While the group claims to promote ""non-violence,"" it includes – without comment – ""political violence"" as a part of the continuum of protest, including ""armed revolts,"" ""riots,"" ""terrorism"" and ""insurrections.""
#ResistTrump outlines a ""theory of change"" to ""remove or replace Trump"" and realize a ""future without Trump.""
As an investigative journalist, I am reporting on the protest industry and its propaganda, because these protests are not just political statements. They are well-financed, orchestrated performances—designed to generate viral imagery, manipulate public perception and blur the line between civic engagement and ideological agitation.
Fairfax County resident Lissa Kenkel, a researcher who helped me cull data for the #NoKings protest, has been studying protests since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas in Israel, and she said: ""The irony is staggering about the groups driving the NoKings uprisings.""
""The very people bankrolling and leading these so-called grassroots movements are the crowned royalty of the non-profit world, sitting in their air-conditioned offices, collecting six-figure salaries, while encouraging the common folk to torch their own cities in the name of 'saving democracy,"" she said. ""It's manufactured chaos, sold as revolution, by people who wouldn't last five minutes in the rubble they're creating.""
Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, based in New York, earned $648,786 in annual income from the group, according to his group's latest tax filing. At the American Federation of Teachers, Weingarten raked in $474,951, according to its last IRS filing. At the ACLU, its executive director, Anthony Romero, collected $1.3 million, according to the group's latest tax filing.
This is what is behind these protests: elite partisan leaders in ideologically motivated networks using the mask of social justice to wage political and cultural warfare in America. For too long, we've underestimated the power of identity politics fused with institutional influence. The streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. are now the stages for these manipulations.
We must not be fooled. True protest rises from the people. This? These are the kings and queens of the Democratic political machine summoning their minions to take to the streets to feign a fake people's revolution.",
politics,Donald Trump stunt proves FIFA is happy to play politics when it suits,https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/19143654/GettyImages-2220117470-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6438516/2025/06/20/donald-trump-juventus-fifa-politics,"Timothy Weah sounded like someone who felt he had been ambushed.
'It was all a surprise to me, honestly,' the United States national-team player told reporters of his trip to the White House, where he was part of a delegation from his Italian club Juventus standing awkwardly in the Oval Office as President Donald Trump answered media questions about a possible U.S. attack on Iran and riffed about transgender women in sport.

'They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go,' Weah said. 'It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it's kind of, like… I just want to play football, man.'
Weah looked like he wished he could be somewhere — anywhere — else. Likewise, his Juventus and U.S. team-mate Weston McKennie, who described Trump as 'ignorant' for his response to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
With the exception of John Elkann, chief executive of the Turin-based club's majority shareholder Exor, introduced by Trump as a 'fantastic business person' and 'a friend of mine', the whole delegation looked uncomfortable — not least when the president pointedly asked them, 'Could a woman make your team, fellas?'
It fell to Juventus general manager Damien Comolli to break the awkward silence, answering, 'We have a very good women's team.'
'See? They're very diplomatic,' Trump said.
Among the inevitable media questions about Iran, Israel and U.S. border controls, there was one inquiry about the ongoing Club World Cup being played in the States — or specifically about how the tournament, and next year's World Cup, might be affected by the travel ban imposed on citizens of 19 countries, which, as The New York Times revealed this week, could be extended to a further 36.
At this point, Trump turned to his other 'great friend', FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 'It's not a concern,' Infantino said of the travel ban, adding that the 'learnings' from the Club World Cup would apply to the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
'I don't think he (Infantino) is too worried about the travel ban,' Trump said. 'He doesn't know what the travel ban is, I don't think. Gianni, tell me what the travel ban is. He doesn't know what it is. He's largely sold out.'

Infantino, as is his way, rocked his head back and laughed before reverting to nodding-dog mode when the agenda returned to more serious matters.
To be clear, when Trump said, 'He's largely sold out', he appeared to be talking about the number of tickets that have been purchased for Club World Cup matches. But… well, some of Infantino's growing army of critics might be tempted to say it works both ways.
During his campaign to win the FIFA presidency in 2016, Infantino visited Iran's capital Tehran, where he was asked how the diplomatic rift between that country and Saudi Arabia might impact the sport. 'It's very clear that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics,' he said at a news conference.
There was a similar response at Audi Field, Washington, on Wednesday night when The Athletic asked Juventus coach Igor Tudor how it had felt to be standing behind the desk at the Oval Office on a matchday as the U.S. president discussed affairs in Iran and Israel. The FIFA moderator of the news conference interjected, saying Tudor would only answer questions relating to Juventus' 5-0 win over Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates, and to the Club World Cup more generally.
Two days previously, when The Athletic asked FIFA whether the decision to drop anti-discrimination messaging from Club World Cup venues was related to the current political climate in the U.S., it pointed to its statutes, which say 'FIFA remain neutral in matters of politics'.
Then, on Wednesday, FIFA did display anti-racism slogans at tournament games, but only as a one-off to mark International Day for Countering Hate Speech. If it all sounds very messy, that's because it is.
Keeping politics out of the game sounds like an entirely reasonable position for world football's governing body to take. But it is also the most disingenuous stance imaginable when the same coach and his players had been ushered into the Oval Office a few hours before that game and when the FIFA president has been accused by UEFA, European football's governing body, of prioritising 'private political interests' above the interests of the sport.

Infantino denies that accusation, citing the importance of working closely with the U.S. leadership for the good of the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup.
But the 'bromance' with Trump appears to mark the continuation of a theme.
Infantino was similarly friendly with President Vladimir Putin before, during and after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, accepting an 'order of friendship' medal from him in 2019 and telling the world, 'This is a new image of Russia that we now have' — a statement that did not age well.
Then there was the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where Infantino was accused by human-rights campaign groups of becoming too close to the host nation's leaders and of trivialising the conditions faced by migrant workers there — as explored in depth by The Athletic's Simon Hughes — by comparing them to his own experiences as the son of Italian immigrants in Switzerland in the 1970s and 1980s.
Seven European football associations, including England, Germany and the Netherlands, were warned by FIFA that their teams would face sanctions if their captains wore 'OneLove' armbands promoting an anti-discrimination campaign featuring a rainbow logo during games at that tournament.
FIFA deemed the messaging to be 'political', which in itself seemed like a political stance to take in Qatar, given that it had only months earlier flown the rainbow flag at its headquarters in Zurich in support of the LGBTQIA+ community.
Iranian fans in Qatar were detained for wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan 'Women, Life, Freedom' or the name of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman who died in police custody in Tehran earlier that year after being arrested for not wearing her hijab in accordance with government standards. It is beyond question that the messaging on these T-shirts was political. But so, too, were the actions of the authorities in Qatar in detaining those who wore them.
The 2034 men's World Cup will be staged by Saudi Arabia, another FIFA decision that has led to severe criticism from human rights campaign groups. FIFA has also agreed vast sponsorship deals with Aramco, the Saudi state-owned petroleum and gas company, and the Public Investment Fund, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund that is also the majority owner of Newcastle United. Already, Infantino's relationship with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is a subject of growing consternation within the game.

As with Russia in 2018, as with Qatar in 2022, the financial upside of these commercial deals is widely trumpeted. The political cost is never disclosed.
It is entirely to be expected that staging major tournaments — whether in Russia, Qatar, the United States, Saudi Arabia or anywhere else — should require FIFA and its president to work closely with the leadership of the host nation. But increasingly, it feels as if football is being driven by geopolitical interests and the diplomatic relationships behind them.
Football's authorities are happy to play politics when it suits them and then, at the drop of a hat, or the appearance of an unfriendly slogan or an inquisitive journalist, to put up barriers saying, 'No politics, please.'
But at a global level, the game could hardly be more compromised politically than it has become, hosting men's World Cups in Russia and Qatar, and opting to do so in Saudi Arabia in 2034. And if anyone was naive enough to imagine the U.S.-led tournament in 2026 would be free of such political baggage, then surely the increasingly public proximity of the Trump-Infantino relationship has dispelled those illusions.
Even 24 hours later, the footage from the Oval Office on Wednesday makes for uncomfortable viewing.
For sports teams to be guests at the White House is hardly a new phenomenon, but to expect those Juventus players and officials to stand there in silence as Trump talks about the threat of war — or perhaps to be expected to nod obediently and then laugh along at other moments, like Infantino unfailingly does — was extraordinary.
It would be wonderful to imagine a world in which sport and politics were kept apart. But this is an era when we have seen football clubs bought by politicians, oligarchs, sheikhs and sovereign wealth funds. When the game's leaders are in thrall to world leaders, when so many big decisions about its future seem to have geopolitical considerations at their heart, the opposite is true.
Football? To use Trump's phrase, it's largely sold out.",
politics,"Once known for civility, Minnesota succumbs to spread of political violence",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JX4RHJMQBJKEPDP5BNW6LVGTTE.jpg?auth=7523dc31b1550a979379a209b11954a1b1144eb78b21dcdee5c90a220cb8c8e2&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/once-known-civility-minnesota-succumbs-spread-political-violence-2025-06-16,"From the pulpit on Sunday, Father Joe Whalen exhorted his parishioners to avoid the kind of extreme partisanship and hate that appeared to be behind the killing of one of the church's own, Democratic Minnesota state legislator Melissa Hortman.
It was a message that Whalen felt his congregation needed to hear, even at the Catholic church where Hortman once taught Sunday school, and in a state known for the political civility of a bygone era.
In his homily at the Church of St. Timothy, Whalen told his parish to adhere to the Christian message of peace and warned against responding to political discourse with unkindness or anger, especially when cloaked in anonymity online.
""We can choose all that by our words, by our thoughts, by our actions or we can walk a different path, and we can invite the cycle of retribution,"" Whalen said. ""We know what we need to do.""
Whalen spoke one day after a gunman killed Hortman and her husband -- a crime Governor Tim Walz characterized as a ""politically motivated assassination"" -- and shot and wounded State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The suspect, whom police identified as 57-year-old Vance Boelter, remains at large.
The shootings come amid the most sustained period of political violence in the United States since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Last summer, Trump, a Republican, survived two assassination attempts during his election campaign. In April, an assailant set fire to the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat.
Yet the shootings outside Minneapolis seemed to deliver an outsized shock to many, arriving during a stretch of days in which protests over immigration roiled Los Angeles, a U.S. Senator was forcibly removed from a press conference and a rare military parade rolled though the streets of Washington.
Not only did the shootings serve as a stark reminder of the spread of political violence, they occurred in a state perceived by many - rightly or wrongly - to be a haven of civic-mindedness and bipartisanship, an impression captured in the cultural stereotype ""Minnesota nice"".
While Minnesota leans blue in state-wide races, control of the legislature is evenly split between the parties, requiring lawmakers to compromise to get anything done. Both Hortman and Hoffman were known to work across the aisle.
""Minnesota has a unique reputation, and I think it's somewhat merited. We have typically, at least politically, not been as excessive as other places,"" David Hann, former chairman of the state Republican Party, told Reuters.
""But I think that has changed.""
Several parishioners said the racial justice protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, which were accompanied by looting and violence, had punctured any sense that their state was immune to the excesses of polarization.
""The violence is here,"" said Carolyn Breitbach, 81, after attending Sunday Mass. ""I think people are interested in their own agenda. They want to take things into their own hands and make things right.""
One of Hortman's last acts as a lawmaker was in fact a compromise. Last week, she cast the lone Democratic vote for a bill that cut healthcare benefits for adult undocumented immigrants -- a provision she and her party did not want -- to secure a budget deal for the state. Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, teared up as she explained her vote.
Larry Kraft, a Democratic colleague of Hortman in the House, said he has seen the rhetoric coarsen in the past few years.
""How can it not? The discourse everywhere is becoming harsher and more partisan,"" Kraft told Reuters. ""That said, I think we do a reasonable job in Minnesota of bridging that. We just did with the budget that we passed.""
The 2024 election ratcheted up political tensions in Minnesota. Then-candidate Trump and his allies went hard after Walz, who was Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate, over Minnesota's expansions of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
Harris won the state with 50.9% of the vote to Trump's 46.7%. Trump narrowed his margin of loss from 2020, however, suggesting a shift to the right. The last time a Republican won Minnesota was Richard Nixon in 1972.
Trump condemned the shootings in Minnesota, but told ABC News on Sunday that he had not called Walz, while criticizing him as a ""terrible governor"" who was ""grossly incompetent.""
Erin Koegel, a Democrat in the state House, pointed to those comments and said Trump was fanning political divisions.
""He's the one who is lighting a fire,"" said Koegel, who attends St. Timothy, adding that she was disappointed that her Republican colleagues in Minnesota were not ""stepping up to say that this isn't right.""
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Democrats of trying to exploit the ""senseless tragedy"" and ""blame President Trump — a survivor of two assassination attempts — who is unifying the country and Making America Safe Again.""
Koegel pointed to Hortman as a model of how a politician should behave, recalling how Hortman made her appointment to committee leadership positions contingent upon her promising to be kind and polite to her Republican counterparts.
""That was something that she always preached,"" Koegel said. ""And even when there were really divisive issues for debate on the floor, she would always just be like let's not be angry and mean. We need to be able to debate this civilly.""",
politics,We Encourage Political Violence When We Look the Other Way,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/20/opinion/20editorial/20editorial-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/opinion/political-violence-hortman-minnesota.html,"The surge in political violence during the Trump years has imperiled not only American lives but also our country's collective memory. The details of a new atrocity overwrite the old. Even the names of the fallen evade our best efforts to retain them.
Before the next act of political violence seizes our attention, let us pause and preserve in memory Melissa Hortman, a member of the Minnesota State Legislature, and her husband, Mark. The couple became the latest casualties of our nihilistic politics on Saturday after a gunman killed them in their home, authorities say. Let us also keep in mind John Hoffman, a state senator, and his wife, Yvette, who were wounded in the same series of attacks. Prosecutors say that the gunman, who carried a target list of other Democratic politicians, wanted to inflict fear.
The Minnesota attacks join a grim catalog of political violence in recent years. In 2017 a gunman shot four people, badly wounding Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, at a Republican practice before the annual congressional baseball game. On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of rioters attacked Congress as it was meeting to certify the presidential election result. In 2022 an attacker broke into Nancy Pelosi's home and fractured the skull of her husband, Paul, with a hammer. Last year two would-be assassins separately tried to kill Donald Trump. In April a man set fire to the home of Gov. Josh Shapiro while he and his family slept inside.
Fear has become a fact of life for politicians. Mark Rozzi, a former speaker of the Pennsylvania House, wore a bulletproof vest for several months because of harassment he had received. Some unelected public servants live with similar anxieties. Many federal judges have taken new precautions in recent months because of the threats against them.
Why are attacks on public officials any more worthy of space in our national memory than other acts of violence? The Hortmans and Hoffmans were hunted because of their distinct role in American life. They were parts of a government by the people.
In a different era, the country might have taken time to express its collective grief about the horrors in Minnesota. One can imagine the president and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders visiting and making a unified statement that political differences do not excuse violence.

""After multiple death threats and racist messages, Assembly Mamdani's office is participating in an ongoing investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force,"" a statement from the mayoral candidate's office read. ""While Zohran does not own a car, the violent and specific language of what appears to be a repeat caller is alarming and we are taking every precaution.
""While this is a sad reality, it is not surprising after millions of dollars have been spent on dehumanizing, Islamophobic rhetoric designed to stoke division and hate,"" the statement continued. ""Violence and racism should have no place in our politics. Zohran remains focused on delivering a safe and affordable New York.""
Mamdani, who is vying to be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been criticized by his competitors, including former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for his views on Middle East politics, which reached a boiling point this week amid ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran.
During a recent mayoral debate, Mamdani said, ""Israel has a right to exist.""
But Mamdani refused to agree that Israel has the right to exist as a ""Jewish state"" but rather ""as a state with equal rights.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to the NYPD regarding the car bomb threat investigation.
Despite differing political views, Cuomo condemned the threats made against his political opponent.
""This is an atrocious threat of political violence against Mr. Mamdani. It is unacceptable —I strongly condemn these threats and any others like them,"" Cuomo said on X. ""This has no place in our politics or our society. Thankfully, no one was harmed. This is a pivotal time in this country, and we need to tone down the rhetoric and focus on the people's agenda.""
Another Democratic mayoral candidate, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also condemned the threats against Mamdani.""The hideous threats of Islamophobic violence against [Zohran Mamdani] are dangerous and morally reprehensible,"" Lander said. ""I condemn this behavior to the fullest extent. Hate has no place in New York City.""
Lander was arrested earlier this week by the Department of Homeland Security after allegedly assaulting a federal officer.",
politics,"Mike Lee, prominent Republicans leap to baseless claims about political violence – again","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2214882389.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/politics/mike-lee-political-violence-claims-analysis,"If there was a telling recent moment when it comes to how ugly our political discourse has become, it might well have been the brutal 2022 hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul.
Soon after the attack on the then-82-year-old man, misinformation flowed about Paul Pelosi and the attacker, David DePape. But it wasn't just right-wing influencers leading the charge; it was also the likes of then-former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and a coterie of prominent Republicans.
These theories generally held or winked at the idea that the attack was a 'false flag,' and/or that Paul Pelosi had been engaged in a gay lover's quarrel – even as he was recovering from nearly being killed.
These claims were baseless and highly suspect at the time, and they were ultimately disproven by audio and video evidence. Musk even offered a brief apology.
But that episode did nothing to dissuade some observers from doing it again. And again.
The lure of quickly politicizing a violent attack with misinformation and speculation has proven more tempting than being circumspect and sensitive about a tragedy.
Some on the modern right apparently can't allow that someone on their side could be responsible for such violence, so they've again leapt to link the attacker to the other side with innuendo and falsehoods.
Today's example deals with the shootings of two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife are recovering at a hospital.
Authorities are still piecing together evidence on a possible motive, but Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said the attack was a 'politically motivated assassination.' The suspect who has now been detained after a manhunt, Vance Boelter, had an apparent hit list of nearly 70 targets. The names on the list, which CNN obtained, are largely Democrats or figures with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement. A longtime friend, David Carlson, said Boelter is a conservative who supported Trump and opposed abortion rights.
So much remains to be learned about what spurred the attack, and it's important to wait for more information before drawing definitive conclusions. These incidents are often carried out by disturbed individuals with no neat and tidy political motivation.
But many on the right weren't about to wait for all that; they tried to attach the shooter to the left – and quick.
They pointed to the fact that Walz in 2019 had appointed Boelter to the state's Workforce Development Board – a group of business owners who consult lawmakers. (The New York Post described Boelter in a headline as a 'former appointee of Tim Walz.') But such boards, which are numerous in Minnesota, are not particularly high-profile and generally feature a bipartisan cast of characters.
Others suggested Hortman had been targeted because she in May spearheaded a compromise with Republicans under which undocumented adults would no longer be eligible for a state health care program. Hortman last week tearfully recounted voting for that compromise. But the other lawmaker victim this weekend, Hoffman, didn't vote for it.
Still others pointed to flyers for the anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests this weekend that were allegedly found in Boelter's car, as if he supported those protests. Protest organizers canceled their events out of fear the protesters could be targeted.
Despite the tenuousness of the evidence linking the attack to left-wing politics – and the more-compelling evidence suggesting the opposite – many prominent right-wing figures have quickly cast Boelter as an angry left-winger.
Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah repeatedly suggested Boelter is not just a leftist but a 'Marxist' and linked him to Walz in an X post: 'Nightmare on Waltz Street.' Lee also wrote: 'This is what happens when Marxists don't get their way.'
Musk, apparently unchastened by the Paul Pelosi situation, also promoted a post linking the shooter to the left, writing, 'The far left is murderously violent.'
Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added in his own X post about the flyers: 'The degree to which the extreme left has become radical, violent, and intolerant is both stunning and terrifying.'
Donald Trump Jr. on Monday wagered that that shooter 'went after someone that didn't just blindly follow Democrat radical leftist dogma.' He added: 'It's scary stuff, but it seems to all be coming from the left.'
Influencers went even further, with some of the most prominent and recognizable ones suggesting without any evidence that Walz was somehow involved in the attack. 'Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?,' asked right-wing figure Mike Cernovich on X.
While these claims have been much more prevalent and firm on the right, Republicans weren't the only ones leaping to conclusions. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Sunday that the shooter 'appears to be a hate-filled right winger' and urged his side not to dance around 'MAGA's legitimization of political violence.'
As noted, there is more evidence for this view than the inverse, but we still don't know a lot. Murphy has previously cautioned his side about the political perils of being too apolitical soon after school shootings, arguing it cedes the debate and allows people to move on from tragedy without addressing the problem.
To be clear, these Republican lawmakers and conservative influencers aren't just suggestively raising questions – as their ilk often did with Paul Pelosi's attackers – they're suggesting this is a settled issue.
The situation carries echoes of not just the Pelosi attack, but also other recent major acts of political violence in which the right, especially, has leapt to blame others using incomplete or bogus information.
After the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, Republicans including Trump suggested a link to Democrats' rhetoric, despite the still-opaque picture of Thomas Matthew Crooks' politics and motivations. Some congressional Republicans suggested law enforcement deliberately jeopardized Trump – something that would be a massive scandal – without evidence.
Many noted Crooks had once donated a small amount to a Democratic-leaning group, but that group has been criticized for misleading fundraising appeals. And Crooks later registered as a Republican and, according to CBS News, unsubscribed from the group's email list.
After the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, many on the right leapt to claim the attacks were somehow the result of provocateurs or even FBI agents. (Lee himself tweeted about a claim that one rioter was flashing a badge, when in actuality it appeared to be a vape.)
There remains no evidence for these theories. A report by the Justice Department's inspector general last year found no undercover FBI employees were present on January 6 and that none of the FBI's confidential human sources present had been 'directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.'
There's a real question here about how much of this leaping to conclusions is about prominent people getting caught up in fast-spreading misinformation, or whether there's a deliberate political strategy. Sharing such misinformation is a great way to win engagement and followers – and it also muddies the waters.
Should we one day learn Boelter was indeed a MAGA supporter who targeted Democrats for political reasons, the seeds of doubt about that conclusion will have been planted and fertilized on the right at a crucial, very early stage.
And the price of that is that incidents of political violence could serve to radicalize yet more people against their opponents – and often, the illusion of those opponents' violent tendencies. And there is evidence that Americans are viewing these incidents more through the lens of politics.
When then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was shot in 2011, 71% of people in an NBC News poll said the attack was mostly about a 'disturbed person' rather than political 'rhetoric.'
That number dropped to 46% for the shooting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice in 2017, to 40% for the attack on Paul Pelosi, then to 37% after the Trump assassination attempt.
Each of these circumstances were different. But the total picture is one of a country that instantly searches for political answers. And at this moment, one side of the aisle is particularly anxious to provide them – no matter how true they are.",

He's not happy about the legality of appointing -- not electing -- town supervisors.
Outlawing a ""backroom backward power grab""
Joe Scianablo wants to be the Nassau County town's next leader and put an end to the appointment practice. Of the last 10 supervisors, six were appointed, not elected.
""Hempstead has a dirty little tradition. This ends today I am introducing a reform bill that would outlaw this backroom backward power grab once and for all,"" Scianablo said.
In this case, respected Supervisor Don Clavin is running for a judgeship. It is expected John Ferretti Jr. will soon take over that supervisor job to be in place for the November election.
""One of the politically suspect -- but legal -- tactics that Republicans have employed to stay in power"" is to leave office early, said Lawrence Levy, dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University.
""It's always done underhand through the back door here with the elections,"" one town resident said.
Republicans have ruled Hempstead for seemingly ever
On the streets of the largest township in America, political observers say it's difficult to match the muscle of GOP foot soldiers and powerful fundraising.
""Community politics relates to everybody,"" a resident said.
""Are you resigning for the good of the town, or the good of the party?"" Scianablo said.
The GOP, which has ruled Hempstead for most of the past century, did not directly address an early resignation for Supervisor Clavin, but responded in a statement, saying, ""It's extremely disrespectful to be holding a partisan political press conference on a holiday like Juneteenth. Joe Scianablo owes the residents of the Town of Hempstead an apology for this disgraceful slap in the face. Shame on you Joe.""
""It's really up to the voters. If they don't like this as a political tactic, then they should vote against the party that employs it,"" Levy said.

politics,Democratic leaders accuse Trump of legitimizing political violence that led to Minnesota shootings,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/donald-trump.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-leaders-accuse-trump-legitimizing-political-violence-led-minnesota-shootings,"A chorus of Democratic politicians are blaming President Donald Trump for the violent political atmosphere that they claim led to the murder of one Minnesota lawmaker and her husband over the weekend and the injury of a state senator and his wife in a pair of shootings.
Party leaders, including former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., pointed to the president when asked what has led to more violent incidents that seem to be politically motivated.
De Blasio blamed Trump for the political violence in the country during an MSNBC segment on Sunday.
He told anchor Catherine Rampell that Trump ""has, more than anyone, given the permission structure for this reality. And even what we've seen in the last week in Los Angeles, sparked by a kind of state violence, by ICE being extremely aggressive in their approach to immigration enforcement, that created a response from protesters, most of them peaceful. And then, of course, we saw some who were not peaceful — and I want to emphasize that's not acceptable, protesters being violent is not acceptable either.""
The former New York City mayor added, ""But there's a cycle here of the most important leadership in the country, both in the words he uses and the actions he's authorizing, creating an environment that's becoming more violent, more conflictual. I don't expect him to change.""
The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, was arrested on Sunday following a two-day manhunt in Minnesota after he allegedly posed as a police officer and shot former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, early Saturday morning at their Brooklyn Park home in Minneapolis. Both were killed in the attack.
Boelter allegedly committed the murders after shooting State Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in their nearby Champlin home in a related attack.
When he was arrested, Boelter was found with a cache of weapons, including at least three AK-47 assault rifles and a 9mm handgun, along with a manifesto that listed the names of 70 names and addresses, some of which belonged to other public officials.
Anonymous law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that the list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and information about healthcare facilities.
""I feel like Trump has really popped the lid off of the rhetoric and the sense of hate and violence and promoted this type of environment,"" Sen. Merkley said during ""CNN News Central"" on Monday morning.
""It's profoundly disturbing for all of us,"" he said, after CNN anchor John Berman asked him to describe the ""political atmosphere"" in the country following the deadly shooting.
Sen. Murphy posted a lengthy thread to X on Sunday claiming that the suspected assassin was a ""right-winger"" influenced by Trump and MAGA to commit violence.
""The Minnesota assassin appears to be a hate-filled right winger. So can we stop walking on eggshells about MAGA's legitimization of political violence? Yes, Republicans have also been the target of inexcusable violence, but this isn't a 'both sides' issue.""
He added, ""Trump sends other clear signals supporting political violence. Said he might pardon those that plotted the kidnapping of Gov. Whitmer; threatened peaceful protestors of his military parade with assault. Again, Democrats don't say these things. Not 'both sides.'""
Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., also appeared on ""CNN News Central"" Monday morning to comment on the deadly shooting. During the segment he expressed fear that ""we as a society are normalizing political violence,"" and though he said, ""No one side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on it,"" he argued that Trump has played a big hand in fueling violence.
""But President Trump is the biggest problem here. I mean, he has used hateful, degrading rhetoric from the day he decided to run for president. And then pardoning all of the January 6 attackers at the U.S. Capitol, people who thought that violence was a legitimate way to overturn an election, and Donald Trump gave them a big stamp of approval,"" the congressman said.
During a discussion about the shootings and America's political violence on ""The View"" Monday, co-host Ana Navarro called out President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., by name, claiming their recent feud with Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., over the Los Angeles riots is an example of rhetoric encouraging violence.
""But one of the things that I think we must demand is that our elected leaders, who have the biggest bully pulpits… but that also includes Donald Trump, and I'm going to say his name, because what we saw last week was a terrible escalation of political threats,"" she said, adding, ""We saw him talk about putting — detaining and arresting Gavin Newsom for the crime of having been elected. We saw the speaker of the House talk about tar and feathering Gavin Newsom for the crime of being elected.""
When asked for comment, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital, ""Democrats are wrong to exploit this tragedy and blame President Trump. If Democrats are truly concerned about lowering tensions they should warn their Democrat colleagues to stop telling supporters they are 'at war' and encouraging them to fight 'in the streets' against President Trump.""
""ICE agents are facing a 413% increase in assaults because of violent rhetoric and smears from Democrats, including calling them neo-Nazis and Gestapo for simply enforcing immigration law,"" she continued. ""President Trump – the survivor of two assassination attempts – is uniting the country through patriotism, prosperity, and success. Radical Democrats must stop with their divisive, violent rhetoric.""",

The EGOT winner has had a longtime passion for sports, which she credits to her brother.
""He took me everywhere. When I got famous, I took him everywhere,"" Goldberg said. ""I wanted to do all the things he did. He played softball. He played baseball. He played basketball … and I wanted to do it, and there was no place for us.""
So Goldberg co-founded the All Women's Sports Network, the first-ever global sports network exclusively dedicated to female sports. The network features sports like table tennis, cricket, field hockey, basketball and soccer.
But it took time to create. Goldberg said she's been working on this network for 15 years.
""Everybody I took the idea to … they patted me on the head and said no one wants to watch women's sports – but they do, I do,"" she said.
It's not limited to sports in the U.S., an important factor for Goldberg while she helped to create the international platform.
""I wanted to make sure it was a global network because there is more in the world of sports than us,"" she said. ""I wanted us to see what other people are doing.""
Goldberg hopes to engage women in each corner of the world.
""There are parts of the world where women don't have a lot of rights, but they do have the right to play sports,"" she said. ""So this is helpful I think to those countries as well as to those women because if we can get women engaged with the sports and people can see that they, too, can be helpful, we can put money into them.""
While Goldberg doesn't have a favorite sport to watch, she told ""CBS Mornings,"" ""I really want to convince us to get into race car driving.""

During the visit, as the players stood behind Trump's desk in the Oval Office, Trump broached the subject of transgender athletes in women's sports during a lengthy rant about former President Joe Biden.
""He was never for open border, and you'd think, he was never for transgender for everybody, or men playing in women's sports,"" Trump said.
The president then turned around to face the Juventus players and posed a question.
""Could a woman make your team, fellas?"" he asked.
The players all exchanged glances, but none gave an answer.
The president then turned to face the team's general manager Damien Comolli and pose the same question.
""We have a very good women's team,"" Comolli said.
But Trump pressed Comolli, repeating the question, ""But they should be playing with women?""
Comolli did not offer an answer that time.
""See, they're very diplomatic,"" Trump mocked.
Trump has made combating trans athletes in women's and girls sports a key pillar of his second administration's agenda.
Trump signed the ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order on Feb. 5 after campaigning heavily on the issue in 2024. The order prompted the NCAA to change its gender eligibility policy to only permit biological females to compete in the women's category.
However, Trump's executive order has been met with staunch resistance by Democratic state leaders across the country.
Trump's administration is already engaged in a lawsuit against Maine, and has been sued by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison over the issue as well. Federal Title IX investigations have also been opened into California and Massachusetts' high school sports leagues.
A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports.
Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%.

The rejection comes amid ongoing resistance by the state's Democrat leadership against President Donald Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order, which dates back to February.
The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against the state for refusing to sign an agreement to keep girls' sports for females only. A federal judge on Tuesday set a trial date of April 1, 2026, for that lawsuit.
Prominent Maine Republican lawmaker Laurel Libby, who has emerged as a central figure in the state's battle over the issue, criticized the Democrat majority for not passing the bill in a post on X Friday.
""It is clear that biological reality and the will of Maine people have no bearing on the decisions made in the Maine legislature, as the Democrat majority just voted to allow biological males to continue to dominate in girls' sports and invade girls' spaces,"" Libby wrote.
Athletes and women's rights activists had been lobbying for the state to pass bills banning trans athletes from girls' sports for months.
Back in early May, multiple girls' athletes marched on August to testify before the state legislature in support of three bills on the issue including LD114 and similar bills LD 868 and LD 233.
""[Democrats] definitely asked a lot less questions to the people who they didn't agree with than the people who they did agree with, and you could tell they did not feel as compassionate,"" Presque Isle student track athlete Lucy Cheney previously told Fox News Digital. ""They got emotional just when [pro-trans speakers] were sharing, and it seemed like they really cared for them, and they wanted to support them, and it didn't feel as much as they wanted to hear our side.""
Cheney's teammate Carrlyn Buck said that when the Democrats did come to them with questions, they seemed ""hostile.""
""They just seemed more hostile toward our testimonies when they did ask questions,"" Buck said. ""It felt like a lot of questions were being pestering.""
The DOJ has accused the state of ""openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,"" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News Digital.
Governor Janet Mills, the Maine Department of Education and the Maine Principals' Association have held firmly in support of continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls' sports across the state, citing the Maine Human Rights Act as the precedent for determining gender eligibility.
Meanwhile, two Maine school districts have already taken matters into their own hands, as MSAD No. 70 and RSU No. 24 have each moved to amend their own policies to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports.
A survey by the American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is ""only fair to restrict women's sports to biological women.""
The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participation in women's and girls' sports to biological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18.
But so far, the governor has remained firm in opposing Trump on the issue, even at the cost of taxpayer-funded legal fees.
""I'm happy to go to court and litigate the issues that are being raised in this court complaint,"" Mills told reporters in April.

TORONTO — Connor McDavid is a magician, a Patrick Mahomes on skates, Caitlin Clark with a stick. The Oilers star is the rare athlete who makes you sit up in your chair when he has the puck because you might witness something you've never seen before. That McDavid is playing in the Stanley Cup Final provides the National Hockey League with an immense opportunity — the best player in a sport competing when it matters most.

In Canada, the country is riveted to this Stanley Cup Final. Through five games, the Stanley Cup Final is averaging 3.8 million viewers on Sportsnet and CBC, a two percent increase over last year. Those statistics include 4.5 million viewers watching Game 1 and 4.8 million viewers for Game 2. Keep in mind that the population of Canada is just 41.7 million.
But it's not just viewership. In Toronto over the past two weeks, it is not uncommon to see people draped in Oilers jerseys as a show of solidarity over the potential prospect of the first Canadian-based team winning a Stanley Cup since 1993. The country's most prominent politician, Prime Minister Mark Carney, is an Oilers super-fan who joined McDavid and Co. last March for a pregame morning skate prior to a game against the Winnipeg Jets. Last Saturday, Carney invited Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, for beers and Stanley Cup Final hockey prior to the G7 summit. (Carney clearly hopes this series also features a G7.)
While the series has had an event-like feel in Canada, the opposite is occurring in the United States. Here are the Stanley Cup viewership numbers for the first four games across TNT and truTV:
Game 1: 2.4 million viewers
Game 2: 2.5 million viewers
Game 3: 2.3 million viewers
Game 4: 2.6 million viewers
Game 1 was the least-watched Cup Final opener since the COVID-delayed Canadiens-Lightning on NBCSN in 2021 (1.61 million viewers), per Sports Media Watch. If you exclude the two COVID-altered seasons, it was the least-watched Game 1 since Penguins-Red Wings on Versus in 2008 (2.35 million viewers).
It's not a question of boring hockey. The Panthers and Oilers have produced 39 goals, the most through five games of a championship series since 2010. Three of the five Finals games have been A+ games, as good as we've seen in the Stanley Cup Final over the last two decades. For some context, here were last year's Stanley Cup viewership numbers on ABC, featuring the same two teams.
Advertisement
Game 1: 3.12 million viewers
Game 2: 3.56 million viewers
Game 3: 3.4 million viewers
Game 4: 3.1 million viewers
That's a 25 percent decrease over one year. The NHL and Turner Sports will likely be somewhat bailed out if this series goes seven games again, but it's a disappointing number given the quality of the games and the stars on the ice.
'Obviously, there's less distribution and less fan awareness with the games on TNT,' said John Kosner, who advises sports media companies after a two-decade career as an executive at ESPN. 'That said, I find it really disappointing considering how remarkable the series was last year with seven games and how many of the star players here played in the Four Nations Face-Off, which was really highly rated on ESPN.'
Most fans are not concerned with sports viewership numbers, and that's understandable. You love the sports you love. Who cares if your favorite sport lacks mass popularity? Trust me, I get it. But viewership metrics are of significant importance for sports leagues, given that the money from media rights-holders represents the financial lifeblood of the sport. The same applies to media rights-holders; they charge for ads based on how many eyeballs view the product.
If you want a stunning statistic from my corner of the planet, Sports Media Watch reported through Game 4 'none of the nine Cup Final games on TNT Sports have hit the three million mark, and none of the 13 on broadcast network ABC have fallen below the three million mark. While that is to be expected given the gap between broadcast and cable, it should be noted that half of the final 18 Cup Final games on NBCSN topped three million viewers. (Of course, NBCSN had the benefit of much more attractive series and a larger cable universe.)'
So why are people in the U.S. not watching this great series? Some thoughts.
1. This Stanley Cup Final is particularly hurt by moving from broadcast to cable.
When the NHL reached its seven-year rights agreement with Turner Sports, beginning with the 2021-22 season, part of the agreement stipulated that the Stanley Cup Final would air on TNT in the years when Turner Sports carried it. The 2023 Stanley Cup Final represented the first all-cable Stanley Cup Final in 29 years. A longtime broadcast executive who was given anonymity to speak freely told me regular-season NHL games on ABC did three times the viewership of games on TNT. The NHL made a trade it must live with for the years Turner Sports delivers the Cup Final. The tradeoff was more money from Turner Sports ($225 million annually) over the reach of a network such as NBC (which was offering less annually). Money usually wins here.

'This is an issue that every sport is contending with, and you only get an opportunity to do course corrections every decade or so in a very fast-moving industry,' said Ed Desser, a senior NBA executive for two decades before forming his consultancy, Desser Sports Media. 'Has there been a fall off (in cable) faster than most people anticipated? Yes. On the other hand, the pay TV business is still where the lion's share of the revenue is coming from. The NHL, just like other leagues, is always looking to try and find a balance between revenue and exposure. An additional kind of twist to this is how they're able to develop HBO Max. That's a part of the equation that wasn't really there early on in the deal. In some ways that becomes the solve for the decline in distribution via cable. But it may not be quite equivalent anytime soon.'
2. Not enough casual fans are aware that TNT is airing the Final
Diehard NHL fans will always search out where games air, but it's worth remembering that the NHL on TNT is still a relatively new partnership. Casual fans are ultimately what turbocharges viewership numbers, which is why the longer a series goes on, the more word of mouth attracts additional viewers. 'There's a difference in not being on an ESPN-branded platform,' Desser said. 'For better or worse, ESPN is kind of special, and in combination with ABC, it's just a different animal.'
Kosner agreed with that assessment. (So do I, for that matter.) 'From a sports-fan standpoint, I think TNT has generated and earned a lot of awareness among NBA fans,' Kosner said. 'They did practically seven million viewers (6.96 million) for the Knicks-Pacers series. But for other sports, I think it's more limited. They outdrew NBC for the French Open coverage thanks in part to that unbelievable Alcaraz-Sinner men's final. But the Alcaraz match peaked at 2.6 million viewers, and that's kind of the audience that they're getting for the Stanley Cup.
3. Having just one U.S. media market is a killer
What would Dallas have been worth as opposed to Edmonton as far as viewership? The unnamed executive above believed it would be worth at least an additional half a million viewers on average per game. Markets matter in television, and they really matter here, given that Turner Sports gets no viewership benefit from Edmonton being in the Cup Final. (The converse is Sportsnet, CBC and French language TVAS get a big benefit from a Canadian team.)
4. There is some good news
Lower viewership isn't great, but you'd rather have it be about the platform than a decline in grassroots interest. It is doubtful that millions of NHL fans decided to abandon the NHL this month. Dresser correctly noted that the league is in a much better situation in 2025 than in years past, given the money Commissioner Gary Bettman has brought in from the current media deals. That's helped player salaries rise. But there is no spinning the viewership numbers in the U.S for this series, and it's particularly regrettable because the series has been a great advertisement for the sport.
'To generate two or three million viewers in today's environment is no small feat,' Desser said. 'But the challenge for all sports programming today is you're competing not with what else is on TV that night but with all of the best TV and movie programming that's ever been created.'",

Netball, one of a few sports created exclusively for women and girls, is the most popular participation sport for females in Australia with Netball Australia estimating there are up to a million players across the country.
The professional Super Netball league, which was launched in 2017, has eight teams and 41 of its games, including the playoffs and finals, will now be broadcast on AWSN.
""This breakthrough deal puts netball on screens across the globe and cements our place at the forefront of women's sport,"" Netball Australia chief executive Stacey West said in a statement.
""AWSN shares our vision of taking women's sport to new heights. Together, we're creating a platform for our athletes and game to shine like never before.""
Co-founded by Oscar-winning actor and comedian Goldberg, AWSN was launched late last year as the first global media channel dedicated exclusively to showcasing women's sports.
""I am so proud to be thanking you for joining us on AWSN,"" Goldberg said in a video message to Super Netball released by Netball Australia.

The move allows Fox to tap into the growing appetite for premium sports content by acquiring broadcast rights to the UEFA Champions League, France's Ligue 1, and select Liga MX matches through Caliente TV.
With this acquisition, the company said it would develop a multi-platform business, including the launch of a new pay TV channel and a subscription video‑on‑demand service to complement its free, ad-supported Tubi platform.
Fox said Carlos Martinez, its executive vice president and managing director for Latin America, will oversee the rollout of new sports channels and streaming platforms in Mexico and Central America, which are expected to employ more than 350 people.
Martinez has over three decades of broadcast industry experience in Latin America, holding executive roles at companies such as Turner, Discovery and Fox, the company said.
The company declined to provide financial details when contacted by Reuters.
Last month, the Murdoch family-controlled company said its new subscription-based streaming service Fox One will launch before the fall American football season, as it seeks to reach audiences beyond its mainstay cable television business.
In the March quarter, more advertisers turned to the owner of Fox News, Fox Sports and Tubi to tap its growing viewership. The company beat third-quarter revenue estimates last month.",
sports,Louisiana is poised to hike its sports betting tax to help colleges pay their athletes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LVQCSHCLQMI7BD77EYWW5RKKXE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/16/colleges-athletics-nil-sport-betting/2325f35a-4b27-11f0-8fff-262d6ec54ab9_story.html,"Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments at the state's most prominent public universities.
Legislation pending before Gov. Jeff Landry would make Louisiana the first state to raise taxes to fund college sports since a judge approved a landmark settlement with the NCAA allowing schools to directly pay athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Anticipating the court's approval, Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on NIL payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.
More states seem almost certain to adopt their own creative ways to gain an edge — or at least keep pace — in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college sports.
'These bills, and the inevitable ones that will follow, are intended to make states 'college-athlete friendly,'' said David Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group consultancy and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California. But 'they will no doubt continue to stoke the debate about the `perceived' preferential treatment afforded athletes.'
The new NCAA rules allowing direct payments to college athletes kick in July 1. In the first year, each Division I school can share up to $20.5 million with its athletes — a figure that may be easier to meet for big-time programs than for smaller schools weighing whether to divert money from other purposes. The settlement also continues to allow college athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, such as donor-backed collectives that support specific schools.
The Louisiana legislation won final approval just two days after a judge approved the antitrust settlement between the NCAA and athletes, but it had been in the works for months. Athletic directors from many of Louisiana's universities met earlier this year and hashed out a plan with lawmakers to relieve some of their financial pressures by dividing a share of the state's sports betting tax revenue .
The biggest question for lawmakers was how large of a tax increase to support. The initial proposal sought to double the state's 15% tax on net proceeds from online sports betting. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on a 21.5% tax rate in a compromise with the industry.
One-quarter of the tax revenue from online sports wagering — an estimated $24.3 million — would be split equally among 11 public universities in conferences with Division I football programs. The money must be used 'for the benefit of student athletes,' including scholarships, insurance, medical coverage, facility enhancements and litigation settlement fees.
The state tax money won't provide direct NIL payments to athletes. But it could facilitate that indirectly by freeing up other university resources.
The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the final days of Louisiana's annual session.
'We love football in Louisiana – that's the easiest way to say it,' said Republican state Rep. Neil Riser, who sponsored the bill.
Many colleges and universities across the country have been feeling a financial squeeze, but it's especially affected the athletic departments of smaller schools.
Athletic departments in the top Division I football conferences take in millions of dollars from media rights, donors, corporate sponsors and ticket sales, with a median of just 7% coming from student fees and institutional and government support, according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database .
But the remaining schools in Division I football bowl conferences got a median of 63% of the revenue from such sources last year. And schools without football teams got a median of 81% of their athletic department revenues from institutional and governmental support or student fees.
Riser said Louisiana's smaller universities, in particular, have been struggling financially and have shifted money from their general funds to their sports programs to try to remain competitive. At the same time, the state has taken in millions of dollars of tax revenue from sports bets made at least partly on college athletics.
'Without the athletes, we wouldn't have the revenue. I just felt like it's fairness that we do give something back and, at the same time, help the general funds of the universities,' Riser said.
Louisiana would become the second state behind North Carolina to dedicate a portion of its sports wagering revenues to college athletics. North Carolina launched online sports wagering last year under a state law earmarking part of an 18% tax on gross gaming revenue to the athletic departments at 13 public universities. The state's two largest institutions were excluded. But that might be about to change.
Differing budget plans passed by the state House and Senate this year both would start allotting sports betting tax revenue to the athletic programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The Senate version also would double the tax rate. The proposals come a year after University of North Carolina trustees approved an audit of the athletics department after a preliminary budget projected about $100 million of debt in the years ahead.
Other schools also are taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct NIL payments to athletes. That came after trustees in April voted to convert the Kentucky athletics department into a limited-liability holding company — Champions Blue LLC — to more nimbly navigate the emerging financial pressures.
Given the money involved in college athletics, it's not surprising that states are starting to provide tax money to athletic departments or — as in Arkansas' case — tax relief to college athletes, said Patrick Rishe, executive director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.
'If you can attract better athletes to your schools and your states, then this is more visibility to your states, this is more potential out-of-town economic activity for your state,' Rishe said. 'I do think you're going to see many states pursue this, because you don't want to be the state that's left exposed or at a disadvantage.'",

At one corner, Tom Brady could be walking around looking to buy more cards for his collection. Meanwhile, LeBron James could be hosting a live version of 'The Shop.' And at the same time, athletes and celebrities like Joe Burrow, Jayden Daniels, Rhea Ripley, and Kevin Hart could be competing against a select group of fans attending the show with a $1 million top prize.
In its second year, the three-day event starting June 20 at the Javits Center in Manhattan is billed by Fanatics as 'the world's largest arena for sports and collectibles.' It's been framed as a combination of a sports card show and Comic Con, with Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin looking to go bigger than the Fest's first appearance in August 2024.
Fanatics Fest drew around 70,000 attendees during the inaugural 2024 event at the same venue, and there's been a concerted effort to improve the fans' experiences from last year. Sports card vendors will be spread out more among the event rather than bunched together in their own nook like last year. Fanatics is also improving the spaces for autograph and photo op sessions after an uneven experience in 2024.
There will be a significant amount of exclusive apparel drops and Topps trading card sets, which will include a second Cactus Jack baseball set in collaboration with musician Travis Scott, an F1 racing set and Series 2 Fanatics Fest baseball set (which is different from the recently released Series 2 baseball set). Last year's releases quickly sold out and climbed in price on the secondary market.
The event will also add a live 'Breaking Arena,' an area where collectors can watch and participate in 'breaks' (which is explained here) with dealers, as well as learn how 'breaks' work for those unfamiliar with the process. And for the wild fans, a costume contest with a massive prize haul, including trips to Super Bowl LX, Wrestlemania 42, as well as tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup (last year's winner dressed as a member of the Bills Mafia jumping through a table).

But what makes Fanatics Fest different from The National Sports Collectors Convention, the nation's largest and most prominent pure sports card show annually, is the company's connections to a plethora of the world's top leagues, athletes, celebrities, and social influencers (full list of attendees here).
In addition, ESPN's First Take will air live on Day 1 of the event. Also, athletes and celebrities attending will splash their presence at the event across their social media accounts, so prepare for Fanatics Fest to fill your timeline this weekend. Some examples of funny moments from last year's show documented across the media landscape included Livvy Dunne dressing up as her boyfriend and sports card hobby darling Paul Skenes, and Rob Gronkowski spiking his football card and racing children in the 40-yard dash.
Well let's see it 👀

Through all of that, three portions of this year's Fanatics Fest stand out as the most likely to attract attention:
The temporary museum's 10,500 square-foot showcase will feature trading cards and memorabilia valued upwards of $200 million from the all-time sports greats like Brady, James, Shohei Ohtani, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lionel Messi, Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle. Several of these items have never been displayed publicly, with some coming from the players' personal collections, as well as from 30 individual collectors. Fanatics believes this to be the most valuable display of sports memorabilia ever assembled and it will be under 24-hour surveillance by more than 25 armed security guards, 360-degree cameras, undercover and uniformed police and canine units.
Some of the more notable items should include:
There are more than 200 athletes and celebrities scheduled for autograph signings and photo opportunities within the Fest. But some of the biggest names will be found throughout the weekend serving as panelists and podcast participants to discuss a variety of topics.
Here's a selection of notable panels to be held during the three-day event
In a new addition this year, 50 pre-registered event attendees will compete against 50 stars — current and former athletes, celebrities and social influencers — in eight sports and entertainment skill competitions, varying from quarterback challenges and pitching accuracy to a closest to the pin golf competition and WWE superstar entrances.

Top prize for the overall winner (if it's an event attendee) will be $1 million. Second place will be a 2025 Ferrari 296 GTB, and third prize will be a James 2003-04 Topps Chrome gold refractor card worth an estimated $250,000. If no average Joe finishes in the top three, the non-athlete or celebrity with the highest score will land $100,000.

sports,Laying claim to the lake: UC Davis athletes will sport Tahoe-themed uniforms,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/17/ebb001a4-f95a-4ac7-be7f-dac1b4afa3d8/thumbnail/1200x630/678105f145caf574c437f290af0c3dd9/tz1a-uc-davis-claims-ta-kmaxdkd6.jpg?v=615ad1f23d2ff8b4756bab8f3b539c8e,https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/uc-davis-tahoe-themed-sports-uniforms,"DAVIS - UC Davis recently unveiled its new ""bold aqua"" alternative athletics jerseys to be launched this fall, making a splash in the local sports world.
The iconic outline of Lake Tahoe adorns the uniforms and gear to be worn by nine major UC Davis sports once or twice a season: football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's soccer, volleyball and gymnastics.
UC Davis
""It's definitely a fun thing our fans can get into, our student-athletes and coaches love it. Something different, to shake things up a little bit,"" said Danielle Shank, UC Davis' Associate Athletics Director for External Relations.
It's all in good fun for UC Davis, now laying claim to the lake that's about 130 miles away from campus.
It's a two-hour drive, it's not too far!"" said Shank.
This stemmed from a new Adidas brand deal and multi-year extension with BSN Sports, where, for the first time, the athletics department had funding to launch alternative jerseys for their sports teams.
In dreaming up an idea, the department wanted something that would highlight their world-class academics and make a wave.
Some college sports fans closer to Tahoe are playfully calling foul.
The University of Nevada at Reno sits just 40 miles down the road from the lake.
The sentiment across the state line is -- why didn't the Wolf Pack think of that?
""I think from a fan perspective, there's FOMO, fear of missing out, on such a cool idea being taken by UC Davis rather than by Nevada,"" said Chris Murray, a columnist for Nevada Sports Net.
Murray says there might be a little jealousy bubbling up as UC Davis claims Tahoe.
""If you think of any official recruiting trip that Nevada hosts a prospect on, one of the must-have places they take them is Lake Tahoe. It's a big selling point if you're a University of Nevada coach,"" said Murray.
The reaction that flooded social media after the uniform announcement was split.
Some in support of the uniforms commented on the Instagram announcement, calling them ""clean drip"" and asking the school to ""sell the merch.""
Others on an X post called the branding a ""big stretch"" and several pointed out Davis isn't exactly close to Tahoe.
But if you ask UC Davis, Lake Tahoe is fair game.
UC Davis
""We do have a research center there. We want to draw more attention to that,"" said Shank. ""UC Davis is a humble University. I don't think the nation knows how much great research we are doing and that we are a top 5 public institution for research.""
UC Davis is leaning into its year-round research on the lake through the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, based in Tahoe City and Incline Village, which studies the lake and produces the annual Lake Tahoe clarity report, released Monday.
It comes in good timing. There's a budding rivalry from Davis to Reno.
""Athletics likes to be competitive and we are joining the Mountain West, so we will be playing Nevada Reno all the time. It's fun to stir up some of that,"" said Shank.
In 2026, all of UC Davis' major sports except for football will join the University of Nevada in the Mountain West Conference.
""These two schools will be in the same conference pretty soon. They're gonna be recruiting some of the same athletes in the Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, northern Nevada. There's gonna be competition there,"" said Murray.
UC Davis says the partnership will extend beyond the kits on the field as student-athletes with science-based majors will get chances to visit the Tahoe facilities for on-site learning and team retreats.
Merchandise sporting the new logo will be available for purchase at the Aggie Sideline Store online starting this summer.",
sports,California girl athletes to rally at sports league meeting to fight trans athlete law after track season chaos,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/trans-runner-2.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/girl-athletes-rally-california-sports-league-office-fight-trans-athlete-laws-after-track-season-chaos,"California girls, their families and other activists will march to the meeting of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) in Costa Mesa on Friday to protest the state's laws that allow biologically male trans athletes to compete in girls' sports.
The protest was organized by the California Family Council, which announced the rally in a press release Thursday. Multiple female athletes will speak at a press conference at the event, including Taylor Starling, Kaitlyn Slavin and Celeste Duyst.
Starling and Slavin are engaged in a lawsuit against their school district, the Riverside Unified School District, after a trans athlete took Starling's varsity cross-country spot last fall, and they allege school administrators compared their ""Save Girls Sports"" T-shirts to swastikas.
Duyst went viral for a speech she gave at a Lucia Mar Unified School District board meeting in April, where she cried while recounting having to share a locker room with a trans athlete before track practice.
""This is about justice,"" California Family Council Outreach Director Sophia Lorey said in the press release. ""Girls across California are being sidelined by policies that ignore biological reality. CIF must answer for that.""
The rally will come weeks after the state was rocked by the presence of a trans athlete at the CIF track and field championships, where Jurupa Valley High School's transgender student AB Hernandez took first place in the high jump and triple jump.
President Donald Trump sent a message to the state in the week leading up to the event, warning of potential federal funding cuts if a trans athlete was allowed to compete in the girls championship.
The CIF amended its rules to allow girls who finish behind a trans athlete to be elevated to the spot they would have finished otherwise, but Hernandez was still allowed to compete. Girls who finished behind Hernandez in the championships then had to share the same podium spot with the trans athlete during medal ceremonies.
Trump then vowed to impose ""large-scale fines"" on the state of California for allowing a biological male trans athlete to win multiple girls state titles on June 3.
""A Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the fact that they were warned by me not to do so. As Governor Gavin Newscum fully understands, large scale fines will be imposed!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The Department of Justice announced a federal probe of California over potential Title IX violations regarding its policy allowing trans athletes in girls sports in late May. The state had already been under a Department of Education investigation over the issue since February.
The office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the U.S. Department of Justice sending a letter warning of a June 9 deadline to amend its policies to bar trans athletes from girls sports.
""We're very concerned with the Trump administration's ongoing threats to California schools and remain committed to defending and upholding California laws and all additional laws which ensure the rights of students — including transgender students — to be free from discrimination and harassment. We are reviewing the letter and closely monitoring the Trump administration's actions in this space,"" the statement said.
A bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found the majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports.
That figure included more than 70% of the state's school parents.
""Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,"" the poll stated.
""Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement.""
Newsom said trans athletes competing in girls sports was ""deeply unfair"" during an episode of his podcast in March.

sports,"Greek probes into soccer hooliganism find links to drugs, extortion and arson",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MR57CNF2YZMMTP4JQJN7MKFA2Y.jpg?auth=8ff93570c27dd122fe2513c771bd76ebaf8de18a0d9ad9492a0ba44ae60cc09d&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/greek-probes-into-soccer-hooliganism-find-links-drugs-extortion-arson-2025-06-16,"When a police officer died after clashes with hooligans outside a women's volleyball match in Athens in December 2023, authorities vowed to end the violence and criminality that have plagued Greek sport for decades.
Police launched probes into the hooliganism that killed George Lyngeridis and that had moved beyond soccer stadiums, but also into links between some violent fans and criminal gangs.
These links, they believed, were ramping up the aggression.
While the vast majority of sports fans in Greece are peaceful, evidence collected by police and seen by Reuters alleges hardcore fans, who follow their clubs across different sports, were involved in smuggling drugs, or linked to gangs extorting protection money from businesses and arson.
""[The gangs] used sports as an alibi,"" Sports Minister Yiannis Vroutsis told Reuters. ""They used clubs as a cover for their illegal acts.""
Police have made dozens of arrests, with the latest coming on Monday.
The fan groups' hierarchies and discipline ""offered the conditions for criminal organisations to thrive within them,"" Supreme Court Prosecutor Georgia Adilini has said. Police officials told Reuters gangs can emerge within fan groups or infiltrate them to sell drugs, or seek new recruits.
On December 7, 2023, some fans of Olympiacos soccer club moved a bag of flares and makeshift explosives from a storage room at their soccer stadium to the venue for a women's volleyball derby against Panathinaikos, a police probe found.
""We'll kill you!"" the crowd shouted, according to prosecutors, during an attack on police that led to the fatal injury of Lyngeridis, who was hit by a flare.
Last month, a Greek court convicted a 20-year-old Olympiacos fan of manslaughter and gave him a life sentence.
Lyngeridis' mother Evgenia Stratou said her policeman son never expected to be in such danger. ""That day, it wasn't that simple. They were organised, coordinated.""
In a separate investigation, dozens of Olympiacos fans have been charged with setting up a gang, extorting street vendors, possessing weapons and orchestrating assaults. They have denied wrongdoing, their defence lawyers have said.
The soccer team's official fan club Gate 7 has condemned the attack and said it has never incited violence.
The investigation extended to the top echelons of the club and Evangelos Marinakis, chairman of Olympiacos soccer club, is set to stand trial in the coming months with four board members.
They face misdemeanour charges related to inciting sports-related violence and of abetting a criminal group.
Marinakis and the other board members deny any wrongdoing or knowledge of criminal activity. Marinakis' lawyers declined to comment to Reuters on the case for this article but have called the accusations completely baseless in the past. Olympiacos has said it takes an unwavering stance against all violence.
Gate 7 member Akis Vardalakis, 58, called the case a government witch hunt. But he noted a rise in aggression around sport. ""Sports fandom is a mirror of society,"" he said.
In July 2024, police dismantled a ring extorting protection money from at least 76 Athens restaurants and night-clubs. The gang was also hired by Panathinaikos fans to attack fellow team fans in a war for control, police allege in the documents.
Panathinaikos' only legal fan club PALEFIP condemns all violence and vets new members, its president Gerasimos Menegatos said. PALEFIP could not comment on the extortion, he added.
In December 2024, police dismantled a gang that imported cocaine and cannabis from Spain. Among core members were allegedly fans of soccer team AEK, previously involved in violence and robberies, the documents stated.
In 2020-2021 alone, the group imported about 1.4 tonnes of cannabis and 30 kilograms of cocaine. Their estimated profits topped 7 million euros ($8.07 million).
George Katsadimas, a legal representative for AEK's fan club, said the case did not concern the fan club but a few individuals who also support the team. The legal fan club condemns any form of violence and its members are not involved in any illegal activity, he said.
Last month, police arrested 24 people, allegedly fans of soccer team PAOK in the northern city of Thessaloniki, accused of selling drugs at matches.
""The alleged criminal group, which included some random PAOK supporters but also individuals who were not related to sports, has no link at all to the PAOK soccer team or its fan club,"" said lawyer Ilias Gkindis, who represents the fan club.
Those in the legal fan club have nothing to do with illegal acts. ""They are people who passionately love sports and believe that criminal activity, particularly drug-related, has no place in the fan club or in sports fandom,"" he added.
Greece's judicial system has several preparatory stages and the compilation of charges does not necessarily mean an individual will face trial.
Older fans said they noticed a rise in aggression since the 2009-2018 debt crisis, that left a young generation without work and with little prospects.
""Sports fandom has always been a hybrid space,"" said Anastassia Tsoukala, a security and sports violence analyst and former associate professor of criminology.
A young person can develop other affiliations within a group of fans, and may be pushed into crime in the desire to belong more deeply to a group, climb its hierarchy and make a living, she said.
Greece in recent years cut the number of legal fan groups from dozens to just eight, increased stadium security and toughened penalties for clubs and sentences for hooliganism.
Since February 2024, some 96 soccer matches have been played behind closed doors and authorities imposed fines worth about 1 million euros on clubs, according to government sources.
Police monitor around 300 ""high-risk"" hardcore fans in each major club, a police source said.
Vroutsis said reforms have been successful, while analysts argue brawls have merely shifted beyond the soccer stadiums. Police data shows 700 cases of sports-related crime annually. Critics and victims of the violence say more needs to be done.
""Unlike other European countries, in Greece we have never adopted primary prevention. We have never looked at the profile of perpetrators to reduce that type of criminality in the long term. We are only focused on repression,"" said Tsoukala.
Among those campaigning for change is Aristidis Kampanos, who went into politics after his son Alkis was stabbed to death in February 2022 in Thessaloniki. In August 2023, fan Michalis Katsouris was stabbed to death in hooligan riots in Athens.
""The clean-up I want is not just a job for the state. We must all participate, including club presidents and fan clubs.""
Sport must be put back in the hands ""of families, pure fans, and those who truly love soccer,"" said Kampanos.

sports,Lawmaker unveils Riley Gaines-backed bill targeting transgender military academy students,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/gaines-military-academy.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmaker-unveils-riley-gaines-backed-bill-targeting-transgender-military-academy-students,"FIRST ON FOX: A key House Republican is introducing a bill to keep military academy sports teams separated based on biological sex, with the backing of activist Riley Gaines.
In an interview with Fox News Digital, Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said it was important for Congress to act because it holds jurisdiction over those military schools.
""There are important physiological differences between men and women. I think most everybody knows that. And this bill makes sure that our military service academies, that we've got a fair playing field,"" Johnson said.
""We wanted to make sure we were dealing with something where Congress has some pretty clear authority, and clearly, the management, or the oversight, of the service academies is an important congressional duty.""
Gaines, host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast, told Fox News Digital in a statement that she is supportive of the legislation, noting her own collegiate sporting experience.
""As someone who has personally experienced the consequences of unfair competition in women's sports, I strongly support the Protection of Women in Sports at Military Academies Act,"" she said.
""Our nation's military academies should be the gold standard of fairness, discipline, and integrity—not institutions that sacrifice female athletes on the altar of political correctness.""
She said the South Dakota Republican's legislation ""ensures that protection remains intact for the brave young women training to lead our armed forces.""
Johnson, the lone House representative from the Mount Rushmore State, is chair of the Main Street Caucus, a group of economic-minded House GOP pragmatists.
Gaines famously lost to transgender college swimmer Lia Thomas, after which her activism in keeping women's sports restricted to biological sex launched her onto the national stage.
It's not her first time advocating on Capitol Hill either, having formerly appeared with House Republicans in support of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act and testifying before the House Oversight Committee in 2023.
A counterpart to Johnson's legislation is being led in the Senate by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.
Tuberville told Fox News Digital, ""Our service academies should be focused on preparing the next generation of leaders, not woke indoctrination.""

sports,It's time for sports to take a stand against Trump's excesses,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GHT6MS22DBBEV7GMLBU6Z2FIQY.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/06/19/sports-trump-immigration,"Several hours before President Donald Trump's vainglorious military parade, officially called the 250th Army Birthday Parade and Festival — paid for in part by the NFL — rolled past the National Mall last Saturday, a protest against what many of us see as the diminution of the Constitution was underway a few miles away at Logan Circle. And just as I visited there, Jim Keady was introduced.
Keady resides in his native New Jersey. He runs a century-old eatery and watering hole, the Lighthouse Tavern, in Waretown on the shore. He campaigned for Congress twice in the 2010s, and lost, and once for the New Jersey State Assembly, and lost. But he did win a seat on the Asbury Park City Council in 2005.
What made Keady attractive to speak at a rally sponsored by a group called Refuse Facism was his fearless progressive activism. You may recall him publicly questioning then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie at an open-air appearance in 2014 where the governor touted his response to Hurricane Sandy. Keady so agitated Christie that the governor infamously ordered Keady to 'sit down and shut up.'
But I always remembered Keady as a graduate assistant men's soccer coach at St. John's University in the late 1990s, when the school was a recent national champion that became uncomfortable with the idea of sporting Nike kits after learning they were made by desperately poor laborers in Asia earning wages that kept them desperately poor.
Steeped in Catholic education at Christian Brothers Academy before St. Joseph's University, where he played soccer, Keady also studied theology and social justice at St. John's as a graduate student. He felt the school's complicity in sweatshop labor was an affront to Christian values and human dignity. Yet, his plea to the largest Catholic college in the country to nix its contract with Nike on moral grounds resulted in it telling him almost what Christie would years later — shut up and sit down. So, Keady quit.
But Keady never stopped speaking out against, and standing up to, injustice. Not as a former coach, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound former goalie for the defunct minor league New Jersey Imperials, or a former elected official.
So as tanks, rocket launchers and other gaudy weapons of war prepared to thunder down Constitution Avenue, funded in part by our multibillion-dollar pro football league, Keady, the one-time coach and former athlete, protested, again.
'Today, he has the unbridled audacity to try to use the military of the United States of America to send a message that the military belongs to him and not to the office of the president of the United States and to the Constitution of our republic,' Keady charged Trump, stirring applause. 'We must fill the streets and town squares across the country in ever-rising numbers, not stopping until we become a movement of millions, not relenting until the regime is no longer able to implement its fascist program.'
And then the assembly that Keady addressed departed Logan Circle in a march to Lafayette Square in downtown D.C., which was as close as it could get to the Trump parade.
Keady's presence reminded of a split-screen moment not only in the country writ large last weekend, with the Trump administration saying a quarter million people attended the parade and the ACLU saying at least 5 million turned out to protest. It also illustrated how the dichotomy is reflected in sports. It is the individuals in our games daring to step up to defend hallmarks of democracy — the rule of law, due process, human dignity, minority rights — and not the corporate complex of sports.
Indeed, at a time when the Trump administration is stamping out recognition of, and advocacy for, contributions to our country from people of color, the Athletic reported this week that FIFA, the world soccer governing body, wouldn't include its typical anti-racism messaging during its month-long Club World Cup that kicked off in the United States as millions of protesters like Keady hit the streets across the country. (Anti-racism messaging appeared at games on Wednesday, but the Athletic reported that it would be a one-day gesture.)
The singer and social influencer Nezza said that the Dodgers — celebrated, of course, for signing Jackie Robinson to break baseball's apartheid system — told her to perform the national anthem last weekend in English. Nezza is Latina of Colombian and Dominican descent, not unlike some of the workers in Los Angeles being targeted by Trump administration's immigration gendarmes. So Nezza wrapped herself in Dominican colors and sang a version of the U.S. national anthem in Spanish.
The same day, Dodgers' outfielder Kiké Hernández spoke out about the situation in Southern California. 'I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Los Angeles and Dodger fans have welcomed me, supported me and shown me nothing but kindness and love. This is my second home. I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart.'
If only Los Angeles's Lakers or Clippers made these NBA Finals, the league might have been forced to say something of the same, what with the record 125 foreign players on NBA rosters this season, including 17 from Africa, where countries have been targeted by the Trump administration's travel ban.
But the professional women's basketball players through their union joined with their soccer counterparts and issued a statement standing with those among us living in fear of deportation. The players of Los Angeles-based Angel City FC in the NWSL even wore T-shirts emblazoned 'Immigrant City Football Club' before their home game Saturday against North Carolina. The MLS's Los Angeles Football Club also issued a statement celebrating the city's diversity. Most significantly, on Thursday, the Dodgers said they prevented ICE agents from entering the Chavez Ravine grounds (the Department of Homeland Security said in a social media post that the incident 'had nothing to do with the Dodgers.') That is what every league should be doing, confronting the issue head on, especially when one thinks of the increasing internationalization of sport.
As Dartmouth classical historian Paul Christesen concluded in his text, 'Sport and Democracy in the Ancient and Modern Worlds': 'If we take democratization seriously, we should, therefore, take sport seriously. Taking sport seriously does not mean putting on rose-colored glasses and endlessly singing its praises. It does mean recognizing and acknowledging both the positive and negative effects of sport and managing sport in such a way as to maximize the former and minimize the latter.'
Immigration, in particular, is being revealed right now as a critical issue for democracy in this country. And it certainly is for sports. The NCAA counted 264 international men's and women's college basketball players in last season's Division I tournaments, or 15 percent of the rosters. All sports should band together to stand up for the significant portions of their labor force that are from elsewhere. Thirty percent of baseball players are from Latin America. More than five percent of NFL players are sons of Africa, with many from Nigeria, which the Trump administration is considering adding to its banned travel list.
But it's never been the corporate entity of sport that has reared up when needed, save that brief post-George Floyd moment. We've gotten it twisted when talking about sport as an agent for social change. It's been individuals. They've been athletes or coaches like Keady, acting on their own. Now is the time for the entities they work under to step up.",
sports,Exclusive: Betts-backed World Bowling League to roll out next year,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42WBZ7ZKYFMZ5M3RSHHRFH6I7I.jpg?auth=12f6db8aae0158c0f08f830b7d1e73b188fea175285f4769ab4f06c6e302c4e0&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/sports/cricket/betts-backed-world-bowling-league-roll-out-next-year-2025-06-13,"The first edition of the World Bowling League (WBL), backed by celebrity cricketer Virat Kohli and baseball star Mookie Betts, will roll out with six franchises competing in iconic locations early next year, league chief Adi K. Mishra told Reuters.
The WBL is looking to transform a pastime for millions around the world into a cutting edge, made-for-TV experience via a heady mix of celebrity franchise owners, exotic locations and technological innovation.
""It's an incredible sport which just hasn't been structured correctly for the past 50-60 years and everyone just dismisses it as a recreational activity,"" Mishra, the founder and CEO of sports tech firm League Sports Co, said in a video call from the United States.
""We are going to launch with six franchises in the first quarter of next year. It's going to be a team of four - two male and two female bowlers.""
Mishra did not go into detail about the format but said professional bowlers would compete in the core sport while celebrities would take part in auxiliary events, with teams collecting points throughout the season.
With its origins in ancient Egypt, bowling's heyday in the United States was in the 1960s and 70s when every town and suburb had its own alley.
Even today, some 200 million people put on flat-soled shoes and take to the lanes every year, including 75 million in the U.S., Mishra said.
The WBL is by no means the first attempt to create a professional circuit in the Tenpin game, and American Don 'Mr Bowling' Carter was the first athlete in any sport to ink a $1 million sponsorship deal back in 1964.
What separates the WBL from previous attempts, Mishra says, is its global reach - the league is in the advanced stage of finalising franchises in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and India - and the ambitious vision.
""Our first fundamental premise was - how can we take this and make this an aspirational product?"" Mishra added.
""We want to take two lanes and put them in iconic locations around the world - Hudson Yards in New York, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, a variety of different locations in Dubai and India.""
Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Betts bought the first announced franchise in May and the WBL pulled off another marketing coup when Kohli came on board as a strategic investor last month.
Mishra did not provide financial details of Bett's purchase but said negotiations on the sale of the remaining franchises were in the final stages.
The league plans to simplify scoring, gather a host of celebrity and corporate backers, and use ball-tracking and other technology to create a product that works on television and digital platforms.
Weaving complimentary programming featuring celebrity bowlers like Betts and Kohli around the core sport would make it an irresistible proposition for broadcasters, said Mishra.
""We already have many broadcasters lined up and a lot of them think this sport, the way we've designed it, can fit into their ultra-premium segment.
""A lot of them believe they can bring in other influencers and celebrities, who come in and bowl as well. So there's a lot of 'shoulder programming' that you can create with the sport, which is not possible with a lot of other sports.""
Mishra and Kohli know each other through their joint ownership of a team in the E1 electric powerboat world championship, and the cricketer's fondness for bowling came as a pleasant surprise as the WBL was being in the planning stage.
""Over the years, I've met a lot of celebs who happen to be closet bowlers,"" Mishra said.
""We were speaking about various things about the team and it turned out that he has been bowling and watching it since he was 11-12.
""That was a big surprise for me and we wanted him to be part of this. Hopefully we'll get him to bowl when he has more time for it.""",

Rikki's opened less than a week ago but is already seeing success. A long line formed outside the bar just before the beginning of the game and continued well into the 4th quarter.
""Crowded,"" Nicole Parker said as she was standing in line. ""Crowded and doing well.""
Rikki's just opened last Wednesday. Parker and her friends believe the community needs this.
""Finally! Finally! It's about time,"" they said in unison.
General Manager Alejandra Cruz said the bar has been at capacity every night.
""I think it's really just creating that safe space for everybody, where everybody can come in and enjoy a game and not feel intimidated by the environment,"" said Cruz. ""Even if you're not a sports fan just a safe place to be able to come and just sit, be comfortable grab, and a drink meet with friends. I think that's the spot that everybody was waiting for and also what has made us so successful.""
The bar's opening coincides with the Golden State Valkyries' first season. Melanie Garcia is all in on both.
""This is so awesome to be part of the ground floor,"" said Garcia.
Tuesday, Rikki's hosted a watch party in conjunction with the Valkyries' first away game since the bar opened. Parker was there sporting a ""founding guard"" letterman jacket, a gift given only to Valkyrie's season ticket holders.
""I think it just speaks to how much women's sports are becoming a thing that everybody watches,"" said Parker. ""It's good for the young girls, it's good for everybody. How could you not support it? They're still not paid enough we're trying to generate more money, and I think it's a good thing.""
She had to wait in line until well into the first quarter to get inside, but that isn't discouraging her from coming back.
""We want to support Rikki's,"" Parker explained. ""I will come earlier next time, that's right.""
This is just the beginning for Rikki's. The bar plans to show every Valkyries game all season.",
sports,Fever dream: Caitlin Clark and her teammates are still shocked – and inspired – by the circus following their team,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2215623499.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/14/sport/indiana-fever-caitlin-clark-attention-spt,"Caitlin Clark says that she always dreamed of playing in the WNBA – and dreamed of playing in front of big crowds – but the seismic transformation she has inspired in women's basketball has still taken her by surprise.
'Being on the magnitude it is,' she told CNN Sports recently, 'is kind of hard to imagine.'
During the Indiana Fever's first game of the new season in May, the excitement levels were at a fever pitch. Journalists covering the game against the Chicago Sky compared the energy both inside and outside of the packed 17,000-seat arena to a championship game, not the opener of a 44-game regular season.
Her teammates dreamed it too, though many wondered if they'd ever experience it personally during their careers. During that home opener, Indiana's 37-year-old Dawanna Bonner became the WNBA's third-highest scorer of all time, but all the hoopla at Gainbridge Fieldhouse was something new.
'The atmosphere was insane,' Bonner explained to CNN Sports. 'I don't think I've ever played in front of that many people before, I was a little shellshocked. You see it on TV, but to be in it, it's like, 'Whoa!''
Since its inception in 1996, the WNBA alone was never able to fully support professional players, and Bonner spent 16 years supplementing her income from the Phoenix Mercury and the Connecticut Sun by playing in the Czech Republic, Spain, Russia, China, Israel, Hungary and Turkey.
She said, 'To have all those fans screaming for you is a pretty cool experience, you've gotta get used to it!'
Fever guard Kelsey Mitchell, 29, is now in the eighth year of her professional career and she's also having to adjust to the intensity of life at the epicenter of a women's sports revolution.
'It's an experience,' Mitchell chuckled, explaining to CNN Sports that the intensity isn't just confined to the court in front of packed arenas. 'The media, the constant eyes, some of the eyes you least expect. I've been in the league a while, so this is kind of new for me. I knew it would get here eventually. I didn't expect the impact, but it's such a positive and beautiful way.'
Even the younger players, like 24-year-old Lexie Hull, appreciate that the explosion in the popularity of the women's game could not have been taken for granted.
'I was talking to Caitlin in the locker room, and we said, 'How lucky are we to lace up our shoes and do this for a living, as a job?'' Hull told CNN. 'The amount of people who come out every night and support us and cheer for us, it's pretty surreal.'
Some of those young fans are now dreaming of following their idols into the league. Eleven-year-old Kamryn Thomas and her friend Merridy Kennington and their moms drove 300 miles to see Clark and the Fever play in Atlanta against the Dream.
'I think both of our dreams is to be in the WNBA,' Kamryn said confidently, while Merridy said that Clark is doing more than just inspiring them: 'I just feel that watching her makes me better and better.'
Excitement in women's basketball might seem normal to such young fans, but their parents have told them that it wasn't always this way.
'I've explained to her that I grew up playing college basketball and it was never like this,' said Stephanie Thomas. 'Caitlin Clark has delivered something to women's sports that I don't think anybody else could deliver, and I think she's got a lot of women excited to see the future of their athlete daughters.'
This moment in women's sports is long overdue, and everybody touched by it seems to recognize that things will never be the same again.
Hull said she spent four years playing basketball and studying for a degree at university, assuming that she'd get a regular job at the end of it.
'I didn't think I'd be playing basketball every day,' she explained to CNN Sports. 'This is (now) a real option for girls, they can have these dreams in first and second grade, being a basketball player is now a legitimate goal to have. I just can't imagine what the sport is going to look like when players have been playing with that goal in mind for 15 years.'
While some WNBA players might struggle to say that the rapid transformation of their sport is down to one player, the ticket prices for recent Fever games make Clark's impact hard to deny. TickPick reported a 71% decrease in ticket value when she was injured on the sidelines, while Sports Illustrated reported prices plummeting from $393 down to just $7.
'I like to think our team is here for her,' Mitchell said. 'So, whatever she does, she keeps changing the world, and we're here to support it.'
Clark herself says she can't imagine where things might go from here. She can remember being the young fan looking up with wide eyes and big dreams and she understands the responsibility that she carries now.
'I try to make as much time as I can to sign an autograph because that can really impact somebody's life. Maybe they're going to put that up in their room and look at it every day and have something to dream about, it's not something I take lightly at all,' the superstar guard said to CNN.
'A lot of people didn't believe that women's sports would be in the moment that it is today. It's going to continue to grow and I'm lucky to be a part of it. I think, really, the sky's the limit.'
After missing the last five games, Clark returned to the Fever lineup Saturday against the reigning WNBA champs New York Liberty. In the team's 102-88 win, Clark electrified the Gainbridge Fieldhouse crowd, finishing with 32 points, nine assists and eight rebounds including tying her career-high with seven made 3-pointers.",

sports,"What the NBA's new TV deal means for viewership and national, local markets",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/16102309/IMG_6553-scaled.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6299679/2025/06/18/nba-espn-tnt-deal-contract-viewership-ratings,"This has been a spring of change for the NBA. While the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers vie for a title in the NBA Finals, the playoffs have also been a last stand of sorts for some of the league's broadcast partners.
The Eastern Conference finals were the last time the NBA will be on TNT for the considerable future after a four-decade run. While Inside the NBA is moving to ESPN next season, it may never be the same. But there were also other small goodbyes. This postseason was the last time that local regional sports networks were able to broadcast the first round of the playoffs; next season, they will all be nationally televised.

This paradigm shift is a result of the media rights deals the NBA signed last summer, when it agreed to 11-year contracts with Disney, Amazon and NBC, worth a total of $75 billion. Next year, the NBA will have two new viewing homes, a larger presence on broadcast television and the option to stream any nationally televised game. It will represent a profound adjustment in how fans can watch games.
But at least those changes have already been prescribed and accounted for. The league's future is far murkier when it comes to games broadcast in local markets, which make up the vast majority of the schedule and how most fans watch their favorite team. The long-term local broadcast situation for many NBA teams remains in flux heading into this summer, and the league is also wrestling with what to do after conducting a season-long study into the local RSN ecosystem. The situation is so unpredictable that commissioner Adam Silver said the NBA is trying to get a better understanding of it before it decides whether to expand.
'We do need to figure out something there,' Silver said last week. 'I mean, for the league, we have several of our team regional networks that have actually shut down. Others have recently come out of bankruptcy. Others seem to be teetering. We're going through a transition in media.'
The league spent the past year trying to get a handle on its present and future as cord-cutting has led customers to cancel cable (or never sign up) in droves, which puts acute pressure on RSNs and the pro sports franchises that rely on them for rights fees. Bill Koenig, the NBA's president of global content and media distribution, talked to each team and the RSNs and broadcast station groups, as well as streaming services, before presenting his findings at the league's board of governors meeting in March. It gave the NBA more insight into their predicament, but no easy answers.
Advertisement
Take the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers, the two NBA Finals teams. Their games are on Main Street Sports Group — née Diamond Sports — RSNs. While Main Street exited bankruptcy last fall, there is still uncertainty.
Thirteen NBA teams currently have contracts with Main Street Sports. That number has been culled over the last few years, but will at least be stable for next season. Five teams — the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves and Milwaukee Bucks — chose this spring to stay on FanDuel Sports Network for the next two years instead of opting out of their contracts, according to sources briefed on the deals. One team executive said the difficulty of navigating the broadcast landscape outside of the RSN model has made it 'worse than cable,' as they pointed out why those 13 teams have clung to their deals. While the new national media deals will pay NBA teams about $140 million each when it begins next season, and escalate up to about $290 million in the final year of the contracts, according to industry sources, local TV rights fees are still important sources of revenue for franchises, especially as teams that left cable see theirs drop and those still with Main Street Sports have had theirs clipped.
But if they had left, they would have joined the growing list of franchises that have chosen to get out of the cable RSN business that has dominated local broadcasts for the last few decades. The Utah Jazz, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Portland Trail Blazers and New Orleans Pelicans left their RSNs for a combination of over-the-air networks and streaming (supported by the NBA on the back end).
Still, even franchises with relatively stable local media deals must still weather turbulence. The Knicks just took a 28 percent cut on their local media rights fees from MSG Networks — despite both being run by James Dolan — as the RSN teetered on the brink of bankruptcy while re-negotiating more than $800 million in debt that had come due. The Chicago Bulls lingered in purgatory this season as Chicago Sports Network, their new co-owned RSN, struggled to get distribution. It did not reach a deal to be on Comcast until late last week. The former Diamond Sports RSNs were off Comcast for three months last summer during a contract impasse last summer; the current deal between Main Street Sports Group and Comcast runs through October, according to an industry source, but Comcast has an option to pick up another year.
Despite all that, Silver and others around the NBA say that there is immense interest in its local broadcasts. The Washington Wizards have leaned into that premise in recent years. Monumental Sports, which owns the franchise and the Mystics and Capitals, bought its local RSN — NBC Washington — three years ago. Zach Leonsis, Monumental's president of media & new enterprises and son of Ted Leonsis, said he felt the ownership group had to step in as it saw the broadcasts deteriorate during the pandemic and as it became more difficult to distribute the games. Monumental already owned a third of the RSN, so it got the rest and acquired its media rights back.

'The team started to feel like eliminating a middleman and taking advantage of some of our own capabilities might be the best, the best path forward,' Leonsis said. 'In our case, there was a defensive mindset in not wanting to have our regional sports network be acquired by another company, wanting to protect the integrity of our content, wanting to push the envelope a little bit more on going direct to consumer and developing additional channels for distribution.
'In our view, our network was a small asset, a tail on Godzilla of a larger Fortune 500 company, but for us a core asset, still the number one way that we reach our fans. Today, even. Nearly three million cable subscribers. And we want that product to be a very, very good one, and we didn't want it to end up in somebody else's hands that we didn't sign up to be with. In terms of playing offense, we viewed it as an opportunity to invest back into our rights, and that's really what we acquire.'
Leonsis said Monumental Sports Network is in a good place. They have paid off all the debt on their network. Their digital viewership has more than doubled from year to year.
Leonsis believes that Monumental is proof that there is still plenty of interest in watching sports locally, but the question is how teams can monetize their rights and where they can broadcast their games. Wizards, Capitals and Mystics games are available on cable and through streaming, and Monumental runs it all. That has allowed them to forge different parts of their business together. When they acquired their RSN, Monumental found that the longest advertising deal the network had was a one-year deal and the largest deal was for $400,000. After merging the sales team for the teams and network together, they now have 15 sponsorship contracts of three-plus seasons and 15 deals worth more than $400,000.
That's a decision other teams may soon need to make for themselves. Leonsis said that cable will continue to bring in the most money for teams and linear television will bring in the most viewers.
'But you need some scale,' he said. 'It's harder to launch a single team RSN these days. You want multiple teams. We have the advantage of owning multiple teams ourselves. We'd like to grow in that aspect as well. That's why I think you are seeing some teams pursue virtual mergers, if you will, like it did in Chicago, they're trying to stand up an RSN on its own. It is hard to stand up distribution from scratch that way, sort of in this environment. So it really varies team to team, market to market.'
The NBA has been searching for answers and it may need to step in at some point. The league has discussed a national streaming service for its local broadcasts. While it isn't going to commander teams' local rights, a source called it 'inevitable.' Eventually, the NBA might need to produce games too — which some teams already do.

Next season is likely to be a transition year. Last season, about half of locally broadcast games were available for streaming in-market. Next season, every NBA team but the Houston Rockets could be, if the league reaches a deal with respective RSNs for the digital rights for those other 29 teams as intends to do (Houston is working on it as well, but it is uncertain if the team will be able to reach a deal).
FanDuel Sports Network, owned by Main Street Sports, owns the digital rights for 13 NBA teams and said that it plans to hit one million streaming subscribers by the end of 2025. It is opening to adding more teams or bringing teams it used to have the rights for, according to one source briefed on the matter. The league has a multi-year deal with Main Street Sports Group for those digital rights that will remain in place as long as Main Street Sports meets certain conditions, including avoiding bankruptcy.
In some way, it is already rolling out a smaller version of a local League Pass through a deal with Amazon Prime Video, where fans can buy the right to stream games from those 13 teams in their market. But Amazon is effectively a reseller in that scenario, and there is no guarantee NBA games will be available through that option next season because the league only agreed to a one-year deal with Main Street Sports.
The NBA has considered launching a local League Pass, but that likely wouldn't be until the 2026-27 season at the earliest. It has spoken to Amazon, Apple, YouTube, DAZN, Disney, and Peacock about that idea, and has also considered doing that itself through the NBA App.
The NBA has been looking at how to increase distribution and reach for its games. Koenig mentioned it during a hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation last month.
'If you go to the WNBA app, you will be able to click right on the game and go directly there,' he said. 'It's on a digital platform. You'll be able to access the games. And we're going to even do that beyond just the NBA and WNBA apps. We're going to do that through a number of other partner and team relationships, you might be able when you order food to watch a game from that food delivery app directly to a game telecast.'
The future of local NBA broadcasts is uncertain, but, as the team executive pointed out, it will be much different in a year or two.

Here's what we know about them.,https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/13/55f899da-1008-4636-a3e8-004f99c54c34/thumbnail/1200x630/fc467f499238a8546a0f19b76f218692/ap25164115358441.jpg?v=d2f497bd9339ad99d2e0559414346698,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-airstrikes-iran-nuclear-sites-what-we-know,"The Israeli military targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, research scientists and senior military commanders in dozens of preemptive airstrikes early Friday morning in what it dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion.""
The strikes — which the Israel Defense Forces said included dropping ""over 330 different munitions"" on more than 100 targets in Iran — prompted Iran to launch about 100 missiles at Israel in a retaliatory attack later Friday. The IDF said its Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the missiles, and U.S. officials confirmed that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.
IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin claimed intelligence showed ""the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,"" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved in Israel's airstrikes on Iran.
The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.
The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.
President Trump on Friday urged Iran to ""make a deal, before there is nothing left"" and to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.
Here's a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran's program.
Natanz enrichment facility
Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.
This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran on Jan. 24, 2025.

Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.
Iran also is burrowing into the Kūh-e Kolang Gaz Lā, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.
In testimony Friday before the U.N. about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had ""been destroyed"" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.
Fordo enrichment facility
Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.
This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Fordo enrichment facility in Iran on Jan. 24, 2025.

Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries, Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.
Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.

Bushehr nuclear power plant
Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.

Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.
New reactors under construction at the Bushehr site are seen in this Maxar Technologies satellite image from January 2025.

Arak heavy water reactor
The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.
The U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019.
The Arak facility is seen in this Maxar Technologies satellite image from February 2025.

Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center
The facility in Isfahan, some 215 miles southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.

Tehran Research Reactor
The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country's atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America's ""Atoms for Peace"" program during the Cold War. It initially required highly enriched uranium but was later retrofitted to use low-enriched uranium over proliferation concerns.

Privately owned ICEYE has grown rapidly in recent years and says its fleet of 48 Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites providing near real-time imaging is now the largest, counting Ukraine, NATO and Japan among its customers.
Government agency, Business Finland, said it has assigned 41.1 million euros ($47.2 million) to the Finland-based company's 250-million-euro ($287 million) investment programme to strengthen its position as a global pioneer in space and defence technology.
""It will strengthen the entire space and defence sector and have a wide-ranging positive impact across the whole ecosystem,"" head of Business Finland Lassi Noponen said in a statement.
With the Ukraine war raging next to its borders and global security threats on the rise, the European Union has embarked on a 800 billion euro programme to shore up its defence, with tech startups expected to play a significant role.
ICEYE's satellite constellation works by bouncing a radar beam off the surface of the Earth from approximately 550 km (342 miles) in space to build a detailed picture of the ground, regardless of weather conditions or daylight, the company said.
""We have clearly ended up being in the right place at the right time with this technology. There is a great need to develop such sovereign capability,"" ICEYE chief of strategy Pekka Laurila said.
In addition to data, ICEYE also sells radar imaging satellites, as many countries are increasingly keen on having their own capacity to be able to monitor around the clock what happens on the globe.
ICEYE's CEO Rafal Modrzewski said the increased interest in space was driven both by technological advances and the Ukraine war that highlighted the importance of satellite technologies.
""This technology will be critical for national security,"" he told Reuters in a recent interview.
The 250 million-euro investment programme will allow it to expand its satellite manufacturing capabilities, develop new sensors and upgrade its satellite platforms, the company said.

technology,Stanford researchers develop ‘game-changing' stroke treatment that doubles effectiveness,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/03/blood-clot.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/health/stanford-researchers-develop-game-changing-stroke-treatment-doubles-effectiveness,"Researchers at Stanford University say they have developed a more effective way to treat strokes.
The new technology, called the milli-spinner thrombectomy, has been shown to have more successful outcomes for patients who have experienced strokes, as well as heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms and other clot-related diseases, according to a press release from the university.
Blood clots are clumped together by thread-like proteins called fibrin. The milli-spinner — which is a long, hollow, rotating tube with a series of ""fins and slits"" — enters the body through a catheter and applies force and suction to the clot.
As a result, the blood clot is reduced in size — down to as little as 5% of its original volume — without breaking any of the fibrin threads.
That's important because breaking up the clot can result in pieces of it escaping and getting stuck in hard-to-reach places, the researchers noted.
With the milli-spinner, red blood cells are ""freed"" and the much smaller fibrin clot is removed from the body.
""With existing technology, there's no way to reduce the size of the clot. They rely on deforming and rupturing the clot to remove it,"" said senior author Renee Zhao, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering, in the release.
""What's unique about the milli-spinner is that it applies compression and shear forces to shrink the entire clot, dramatically reducing the volume without causing rupture.""
Time is of the essence when treating an ischemic stroke, which is when the clot is cutting off oxygen to the brain. Studies have shown that for every minute during a stroke, 1.9 million brain neurons and 14 billion synapses are destroyed.
With current technologies, clots are only removed about half the time on the first try, the release stated, and they fail completely about 15% of the time.
""For most cases, we're more than doubling the efficacy of current technology, and for the toughest clots – which we're only removing about 11% of the time with current devices – we're getting the artery open on the first try 90% of the time,"" said co-author Jeremy Heit, chief of neuroimaging and neurointervention at Stanford, in the release.
""This is a sea-change technology that will drastically improve our ability to help people.""
The researchers' findings, which incorporated both animal studies and machine-based flow models, were published June 4 in the journal Nature.
The multi-spinner could potentially be used for other applications, such as capturing and removing kidney stone fragments, the release noted.
The team is now working to get the new technology approved for clinical use, with clinical trials expected to begin soon.
""What makes this technology truly exciting is its unique mechanism to actively reshape and compact clots, rather than just extracting them,"" Zhao said.
""We're working to bring this into clinical settings, where it could significantly boost the success rate of thrombectomy procedures and save patients' lives.""

Inclusion on the economy ministry's trade administration's strategic high-tech commodities entity list means Taiwanese companies will need government approval before exporting any products to the companies.
The companies, both at the centre of China's chip and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, were included in an updated version of the ministry's trade administration's website. Neither company responded to requests for comment outside of office hours at the weekend.
In a statement on Sunday, the ministry's trade administration said it had recently held a meeting to review the entity list, and ""based on the prevention of arms proliferation and other national security considerations"" updated it on June 10.
A total of 601 entities were added, including Huawei and SMIC, along with entities from Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Myanmar, and China, it said.
""Manufacturers must comply with export control regulations, fulfil their verification obligations and carefully assess transaction risks,"" it added.
Taiwan is home to TSMC (2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier of chips to AI darling Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab. Both Huawei and SMIC have been working hard to catch up in the chip technology race.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory despite the strong objections of Taipei's government, already has tight chip export controls when it comes to Taiwanese companies either manufacturing in the country or supplying Chinese firms.
Huawei is on a U.S. Commerce Department trade list that essentially bars it from receiving U.S. goods and technology, as well as foreign-made goods such as chips from companies like TSMC made with U.S. technology.
Last October, TechInsights, a Canadian tech research firm, took apart Huawei's 910B AI processor and found a TSMC chip in it. The multi-chip 910B is viewed as the most advanced AI accelerator mass-produced by a Chinese company.
TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo, whose chip matched the one in the Huawei 910B and, in November the U.S. Commerce Department ordered TSMC to halt shipments of more chips to Chinese customers.
Taiwan's government has also repeatedly vowed to crack down on what it says are efforts by Chinese companies, including SMIC, to steal technology and entice chip talent away from the island.
SMIC is China's largest chipmaker and has ramped up investment to expand production capacity and strengthen China's domestic semiconductor capability in the face of sweeping U.S. export controls.",

The report by a nonprofit that does research for Congress faulted some towers for inefficient practices. But it also pointed to external obstacles, including government shutdowns and the Covid pandemic, that compounded the F.A.A.'s difficulty in keeping control towers staffed overall. The shortages have contributed to near-misses and other accidents that, combined with outmoded and problematic technology, have heightened concerns about the safety of air travel.
'Scanning the horizon, it's become clear that the U.S. needs to make a few important course corrections to ensure that F.A.A.'s facilities are adequately staffed, helping keep our skies safe for decades to come,' William J. Strickland, the chair of the committee that wrote the 250-page report, said in a statement accompanying its release.
Mr. Strickland is the former head of the Human Resources Research Organization, which provides staffing assessments for companies and the government.
The report from the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, a nonprofit authorized by Congress to provide advice to the federal government on matters of science and technology, was ordered by lawmakers as part of legislation authorizing the F.A.A. to embark on new key ventures. Those include accelerating the hiring of air traffic controllers and investments in advancements in aviation infrastructure and advanced technology.
It was published at a moment of heightened scrutiny of aviation safety and the air traffic control system in particular, following a deadly Jan. 29 crash at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Since then, there has been a series of near-misses and outages, including multiple failures at Newark International Airport, where staffing at the facilities monitoring air traffic remains alarmingly low.

technology,Texas startup sells plastic-eating fungi diapers to tackle landfill waste,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5IYGN5JKSZKO3BKHDQ6YBFKF6A.jpg?auth=9fb3aea8284c5053a830a2adba4a87500263317cdab904b36bbe2d0e64bbb326&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/texas-startup-sells-plastic-eating-fungi-diapers-tackle-landfill-waste-2025-06-16,"AUSTIN, Texas, June 16 (Reuters) - Could baby poop and fungi work together to tackle landfill waste? That's the idea behind a new product launched by an Austin, Texas-based startup that sells disposable diapers paired with fungi intended to break down the plastic.
Each of Hiro Technologies' MycoDigestible Diapers comes with a packet of fungi to be added to the dirty diaper before it is thrown in the trash. After a week or two, the fungi are activated by moisture from feces, urine and the environment to begin the process of biodegradation.
Disposable diapers contribute significantly to landfill waste. An estimated 4 million tons of diapers were disposed of in the United States in 2018, with no significant recycling or composting, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Diapers take hundreds of years to naturally break down. That means the very first disposable diaper ever used is still in a landfill somewhere.
To tackle this, Hiro Technologies turned to fungi. These organisms - which include mushrooms, molds, yeasts and mildew - derive nutrients from decomposing organic matter. In 2011, Yale University researchers discovered a type of fungus in Ecuador that can feed on polyurethane, a common polymer in plastic products. They figured the fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, would be capable of surviving on plastic in environments lacking oxygen, like landfills.
Hiro Technologies co-founder Tero Isokauppila, a Finnish entrepreneur who also founded medicinal mushroom company Four Sigmatic, said there are more than 100 species of fungi now known to break down plastics.
""Many, many moons ago, fungi evolved to break down trees, especially this hard-to-break-down compound in trees called lignin. ... Its carbon backbone is very similar to the carbon backbone of plastics because essentially they're made out of the same thing,"" Isokauppila said.
Three sealed jars at Hiro Technologies' lab show the stages of decomposition of a treated diaper over time. By nine months, the product appears as black soil - ""just digested plastic and essentially earth,"" Isokauppila said.
The company says it needs to do more research to find out how the product will decompose in real-world conditions in different climates and hopes to have the data to make a ""consumer-facing claim"" by next year. It also plans to experiment with plastic-eating fungi on adult diapers, feminine care products and other items.
For now, it is selling ""diaper bundles"" for $35 a week online. Co-founder Miki Agrawal, who was also behind period underwear company Thinx, said the MycoDigestible Diapers had been generating excitement from consumers and investors since launching about a month ago, declining to give details. Agrawal said the company had chosen to focus on diapers as the top household plastic waste item.
""There is a deleterious lasting effect that we haven't really thought about and considered,"" Agrawal said. ""Because when you throw something away, no one's asking themselves, 'Where's away?'""",

Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, made the remarks in a speech in Belgium, where he was receiving an award from Imec, an independent semiconductor research and development group that works closely with most of the world's biggest chipmakers.
In the speech, a recording of which was reviewed by Reuters, Srouji outlined Apple's development of custom chips from the first A4 chip in an iPhone in 2010 to the most recent chips that power Mac desktop computers and the Vision Pro headset.
He said one of the key lessons Apple learned was that it needed to use the most cutting-edge tools available to design its chips, including the latest chip design software from electronic design automation (EDA) firms.
The two biggest players in that industry - Cadence Design Systems (CDNS.O), opens new tab and Synopsys (SNPS.O), opens new tab - have been racing to add artificial intelligence to their offerings.
""EDA companies are super critical in supporting our chip design complexities,"" Srouji said in his remarks. ""Generative AI techniques have a high potential in getting more design work in less time, and it can be a huge productivity boost.""
Srouji said another key lesson Apple learned in designing its own chips was to make big bets and not look back.
When Apple transitioned its Mac computers - its oldest active product line - from Intel's chips to its own chips in 2020, it made no contingency plans in case the switch did not work.
""Moving the Mac to Apple Silicon was a huge bet for us. There was no backup plan, no split-the lineup plan, so we went all in, including a monumental software effort,"" Srouji said.",

The companies will jointly-develop European variants of Anduril's Barracuda and Fury aerial drones, as well as exploring opportunities to build solid rocket motors, which are used to propel missiles and rockets.
""By integrating Anduril's solutions into Rheinmetall's European production setup and digital sovereignty framework, we're building on that foundation to bring new kinds of autonomous capabilities into service, ones that are quick to produce, modular, and aligned with NATO's evolving requirements,"" said Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall.
In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and amid concerns over U.S. defence commitments under President Donald Trump, many European nations have pledged to increase military spending.
However, Europe continues to depend heavily on U.S. defence firms to fill critical capability gaps - not only in traditional systems like fighter jets and missiles, but also in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, low-Earth orbit satellites and drones.
California-based Anduril is part of a wave of U.S. defence technology companies - including AI firm Palantir and Elon Musk's SpaceX - that are challenging traditional defence manufacturing giants with faster innovation.
The war in Ukraine has shown the increasing importance of drones in modern warfare. The Barracuda is designed to be cheap, fast to build and easy to launch in large numbers and can act like a cruise missile. Fury is a more expensive, stealthier, longer-range drone designed for combat and surveillance.
""This is a different model of defense collaboration, one built on shared production, operational relevance, and mutual respect for sovereignty,"" said Brian Schimpf, CEO of Anduril Industries.
""Together with Rheinmetall, we're building systems that can be produced quickly, deployed widely, and adapted as NATO missions evolve.""",

Ulbrich will work to broaden the company's relationships in Hollywood and collaborate with Moonvalley's studio arm, Asteria Film, to promote adoption of its technology.
He said in an interview he sees parallels between the rise of generative AI and the birth of computer-generated imagery, which revolutionized visual effects in film decades earlier.
""A lot of people worried we were going to be getting rid of jobs, so I've seen this before,"" Ulbrich said. ""By the way, history will show hundreds of thousands of jobs were created from that bloom in technology.""
Moonvalley is one of several artificial intelligence companies looking to establish a foothold in Hollywood.
The company has looked to position itself as respectful of copyright, using only licensed works used to train its AI video model, Marey.
The unauthorized use of film and television libraries has become a recent flashpoint, leading two major Hollywood studios to file a lawsuit against another AI company, Midjourney.
'What drew me to Moonvalley is their respect for the craft, their use of clean, licensed data, and their focus on empowering creators,"" Ulbrich said.
Ulbrich has more than three decades of experience in visual effects, with more than 50 film and television and 500 commercial credits. He also helped pioneer live digital human performances with a holographic projection of the late rapper Tupac Shakur at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012.
Prior to joining Moonvalley, Ulbrich served as chief content officer and production president at Metaphysic, a generative AI company best known for technology used to age and de-age actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in the movie ""Here."" That company was acquired in February by DNEG Group.
He also held senior roles at Deluxe and Digital Domain, where he served as CEO.",

""I'm bored!""
So, what can parents do to keep their kids active, entertained, and from hearing that infamous complaint?
According to doctors, it can be helpful to sit down with your kids and make an ""I'm Bored Jar."" Inside it, you can write down ideas for different summer activities. Picking them at random can bring a form of unpredictability and entertainment.
These ideas inside the ""I'm Bored Jar"" don't have to be expensive or require a lot of effort.
They can include camping in the backyard, going for a walk or a hike through the neighborhood, building a fort inside the house, or simply playing a board game.
It's also important to remember not to overschedule your child's time. It's OK for them to get bored from time to time.
""So, the exact opposite of boredom is being overscheduled,"" explained Dr. Richard So, a pediatrician at the Cleveland Clinic. ""You know you have camp, then you have a soccer game, then you have music lessons, you know? There are some kids that need that type of structure, where if they're not doing anything, their mind can wander to other places.""
The Cleveland Clinic recommends deciding what the right balance is for your family.
They also said it's OK if they spend time on screens this summer, especially if it's a rainy day.
However, they do recommend keeping it in moderation.",

It also resolves claims raised in Allen's related $100 million lawsuit against McDonald's in Los Angeles Superior Court.
McDonald's said it will buy ads ""at market value"" from Allen's companies ""in a manner that aligns with its advertising strategy and commercial objectives.""
Settlement terms are confidential. McDonald's, based in Chicago, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
In a statement, Allen's companies said ""we acknowledge McDonald's commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity. Our differences are behind us.""
Allen accused McDonald's of falsely labeling Entertainment Studios as a media company that produces content solely for Black viewers, consigning it to its ""de minimis"" ad budget for those viewers instead of its general ad budget.
He also accused McDonald's of lying when it pledged in 2021 to boost national ad spending with those media to 5% from 2% by 2024.
Allen said he relied on that pledge when seeking business from McDonald's, only to be rebuffed, and that his Allen Media Group represented more than 90% of Black-owned media.
Allen's networks include The Weather Channel, Cars.TV, Comedy.TV, ES.TV, Justice Central, MyDestination.TV, Pets.TV and Recipe.TV.",

California-based MGA – which is a major supplier of toys to U.S. firms Walmart (WMT.N), opens new tab and Target (TGT.N), opens new tab and also owns the Bratz dolls brand – was sued in 2020 by startup Cabo Concepts.
Cabo alleged MGA stifled the launch of Cabo's Worldeez range by asserting that the toys' globe packaging was an imitation of MGA's L.O.L. Surprise! and threatening to withhold supplies of L.O.L. Surprise! to retailers that stocked the Worldeez globe.
The Worldeez toy ultimately failed and was discontinued in 2018, prompting Cabo to sue MGA, seeking up to 90 million pounds ($122 million) in damages for lost profits.
Judge Kelyn Bacon on Monday rejected Cabo's argument that it would have traded profitably but for MGA's conduct, saying in a written ruling that ""Cabo's claim for damages therefore fails"".
The judge did, however, find that MGA had abused its dominant position by making threats to withdraw the supply of L.O.L. Surprise! dolls, ""reinforced by threats of litigation and disparaging claims that Worldeez was a 'knock off'"".
Bacon also said that MGA made ""unjustified threats of patent infringement proceedings"" to major retailers Toys 'R' Us, The Entertainer and Smyths.
MGA took ""retaliatory anti-competitive action"" against Cabo in an attempt to ""stifle legitimate competition by exercising its market power to cut off the main retail outlets"", she added.

""This particular game, I'm sweating. There's so much that is required to be online, the screen and getting us to move our bodies is so great,"" he said.
The floors light up. The walls throw challenges. And the scoreboard keeps you humble, especially when you're playing catch-up with a 12-year-old.
A one-hour session costs $35 per person or $45 for 90 minutes. Jill McCall said she's not usually a fan of malls, but this one was a slam dunk.
""I typically try to avoid malls as much as possible for a very long time,"" she said. ""It's just an overstimulating place typically and this is definitely something that brought us back into a mall environment.""
Across the country, malls are in a slump. According to Capital Shopping Research, up to 87% of large shopping malls are predicted to close over the next decade.
Paco Underhill, author of Call of the Mall, who has been tracking these trends for decades, said malls are now shifting from retail hubs to experience-driven destinations — places that blend entertainment, dining and even housing.
""The larger context of the shopping mall is, 'Can I make it a real city?' It's what we call placemaking,"" he said.
As for the McCalls, they made it to the top of the scoreboard, but that, said Nathan, was never the point.
""The score is great, but we don't spend a lot of time looking (at the score); the place we spend a lot of time looking at is each other,"" Nathan McCall said.",

Prologue
He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning—her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy—was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who ""invented television.""
""There's a misconception that we—that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,"" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. ""And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.""
Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure—""one of the great personalities of all time,"" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.
It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once—a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.
""I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,"" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. ""Lucy and Desi—I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.""

entertainment,Netflix Dips Its Toe Into Old-Fashioned TV,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/NETFLIX-TF1-cqbm/NETFLIX-TF1-cqbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/business/media/netflix-tf1-tv.html,"Netflix is getting into the old-fashioned TV business.
The streaming giant announced a deal on Wednesday to show live and on-demand programming from one of France's television networks, TF1. The partnership, the first of its kind for Netflix, means that the company's subscribers in France will have access to TF1's broad array of programming, including game shows like 'The Voice,' as well as live sporting events and soap operas without leaving the service.
'By teaming up with France's leading broadcaster,' Greg Peters, a co-chief executive of Netflix, said in a statement, 'we will provide French consumers with even more reasons to come to Netflix every day and to stay with us for all their entertainment.' Mr. Peters flew to Cannes, France, this week for a large annual advertising festival to announce the partnership with Rodolphe Belmer, the chief executive of TF1.
The programming is expected to start appearing on Netflix next summer. Netflix said back in 2022 that it had 10.1 million subscribers in France. It has not shared updated numbers since.
The partnership could prove to be a model for Netflix for other markets around the world. The company has spent extensive time and money in recent years on building up its live entertainment capabilities. Last November, the company attracted 108 million viewers during the live Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fighting spectacle and a month later lured another 65 million to watch two National Football League games and a Beyoncé halftime show on Christmas Day.
The company is also still increasing its advertising business, another revenue stream that is in its early stages. Netflix says 94 million active users are signed up to its cheaper tier, which has commercials.
TF1 is one of the two largest private broadcasters in France. In 2021, the company tried to merge with its rival M6 Group as a way to combat the rising U.S. streaming companies. But it abandoned those efforts the next year because of antitrust concerns.
TF1 currently reaches 58 million viewers with its broadcast channels and serves 35 million users on its streaming channel, TF1+. Yet the company sees this new deal as a way to attract more viewers and increase its advertising revenue as a result.
'As viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases, this unprecedented alliance will enable our premium content to reach unparalleled audiences and unlock new reach for advertisers within an ecosystem that perfectly complements our TF1+ platform,' Mr. Belmer said in a statement.
TF1 and Netflix have worked together on a number of productions over the years, including 'Les Combattantes,' 'L'Agence' and 'Tout le bleu du ciel.'",

PSG has outgrown the 48,000-capacity Parc des Princes, and team officials will spend a year studying potential sites in Massy and Poissy with an eye toward offering a variety of entertainment options, Melero said.
""The next challenge is a new stadium,"" Melero told Reuters in Los Angeles ahead of PSG's Club World Cup match on Sunday in Pasadena.
""For one year we're going to go into an analysis and make a choice for our future, and we're inspired by what is going on in the U.S. with sports facilities,"" he said.
""One example here is SoFi Stadium. It's incredible and much more than a sports facility - it really is part of entertainment and shows. So that is what we really want to push to diversify our revenue.""
SoFi Stadium, a technological marvel that opened in 2020, is home to the NFL's Rams and Chargers and has hosted concerts by artists like Taylor Swift and Beyonce. It will play a key role in next summer's World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
The $5 billion stadium is located in Hollywood Park, a growing commercial and residential area. The 70,000-capacity indoor-outdoor stadium sits next to Intuit Dome, the high-tech NBA arena that opened last year.
PSG is looking at Massy, south of Paris, and Poissy, west of the French capital, as potential sites for a new stadium. The team will play Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future while the new stadium is built.
U.S. fans and investors have played a vital role in the stunning success of the club both on and off the field, said Adrien Frier, the French consul-general in Los Angeles.
""Paris St Germain is what you would call in the tech sector a unicorn, and it's a unicorn that has some American blood in it,"" he said at a reception honoring the team in Beverly Hills, where the Champions League trophy was on display.
PSG has an estimated five million fans in the U.S. and has benefited from its high-profile partnership with Nike's iconic Air Jordan brand.
U.S.-based Arctos Partners holds 12.5% of the shares of the team, with majority owner Qatar Sports Investments owning the remaining 87.5% for a club that is valued at $4.4 billion.
Melero said the team's ambitions are only growing.
""We wrote the story of the club with that cup,"" he said, gesturing toward the gleaming trophy.
""And right now the next move is to write the story of football with this very young team.""",

""The pessimism is up significantly,"" Charlie Wise, head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, told Reuters in an interview. ""There's a very clear correlation between that pessimism and the uncertainty that's come out of the tariffs.""
More than half of respondents said they reduced discretionary spending on dining out, travel and entertainment in the last three months, and 23% saying they had boosted emergency savings.
Consumers who were most concerned about tariffs also expressed plans to borrow more, including through credit cards, personal loans and buy now, pay later services, the survey showed.
Inflation was the top concern for 81% of respondents, while the fear of a recession rose to its highest level in two years.",

Kelly moved to the north London club on loan from Manchester City in January and it proved a successful switch as the 27-year-old winger helped Arsenal win the Champions League.

Her contract with City expires at the end of this month and suitors from the Women's Super League (WSL), elsewhere in Europe and the United States have all registered an interest.
But Kelly has instructed her representatives to give Arsenal first refusal in negotiations and they are working to reach an agreement for the England international to join as a free agent.
The discussions currently centre on a potential three-year term and only if a compromise cannot be found will she entertain other teams.
There is a high level of mutual respect between Kelly and Arsenal — where her senior career started — and this has helped create a willingness on both sides to strike a deal.
Kelly made just one league start for City last season. At Arsenal she made 13 appearances, six league starts, scoring two and assisting six goals.

And yet, as the elite of the media and entertainment industries flocked to Cannes this week for the world's top ad festival, two heavyweights squared off.
On one end of the beach where ad deals are struck over glasses of rosé: Michael Kassan, 74, a ringmaster of the marketing industry.

On the other end: United Talent Agency, the Hollywood power broker that bought MediaLink in 2021.

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed, opens new tab on Thursday, dispute resolution firm New Era ADR said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had last year misinterpreted its rules in a decision rejecting Live Nation's efforts to require consumers to agree to arbitrate any disputes when they purchased tickets.
Live Nation was accused of charging artificially high ticket prices in a lawsuit that the event company tried unsuccessfully to move them into arbitration. The 9th Circuit had last year rejected New Era's arbitration rules and said the consumer plaintiffs could sue Live Nation in a proposed class action in federal court.
New Era is not a party in the lawsuit. It submitted a filing to the justices as a friend of the court, defending its practices. Live Nation has denied any wrongdoing.
The case, which the Supreme Court has not yet agreed to hear, could give the justices a fresh chance to weigh the contours of the Federal Arbitration Act and whether so-called mass arbitration fits into the decades-old law.
Live Nation in its petition, opens new tab to the high court said plaintiffs' lawyers were increasingly pursuing mass arbitration as a pressure tactic to force companies to settle what it called meritless claims.
Live Nation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lead attorney for the plaintiffs declined to comment.
New Era chief executive Rich Lee in a statement said the company was ""focused on removing gamesmanship and impediments to ensure that all parties have their cases heard and efficiently resolved on their merits.""
Companies often promote arbitration as a more efficient way for individual consumers to air their disputes outside of court.
As more companies have employed arbitration agreements to steer consumer claims away from the federal courts, plaintiffs' lawyers have increasingly turned to mass arbitrations, filing thousands of individual arbitration demands that are nearly identical.
Live Nation in 2021 had turned to New Era, a new dispute resolution company, to use its mass arbitration platform.
A federal judge in 2023 had ruled that Live Nation could not enforce its arbitration provisions, and the 9th Circuit had last year upheld the decision.
The 9th Circuit had determined that New Era's mass arbitration rules were 'so dense, convoluted and internally contradictory to be borderline unintelligible.'
New Era's Supreme Court filing said its rules 'have remained centered on keeping mass arbitration workable, accessible, fast, and merits-based for all parties involved.'
In a separate filing, opens new tab on Thursday, lawyers for the consumers urged the justices to leave the 9th Circuit's order in place.
The case is Live Nation Entertainment et al v. Skot Heckman et al, U.S. Supreme Court, No.
For plaintiffs: Warren Postman of Keller Postman, and Kevin Teruya of Quinn Emanuel
For Live Nation: Roman Martinez and Tim O'Mara of Latham & Watkins
For New Era: Sandra Musumeci of Kelley Drye & Warren

entertainment,Remember Fonzworth Bentley? Here's what happened after he moved on from holding umbrellas for Sean ‘Diddy' Combs,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-543928862.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://us.cnn.com/2025/06/17/entertainment/fonzworth-bentley-sean-diddy-combs,"Before there were influencers, Fonzworth Bentley became famous for being adjacent to the influential — namely Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
Whether he was the umbrella-holder-in-chief or making appearances on Combs' various television projects, as Combs' personal assistant, Bentley was in the orbit of new millennium cool of the early aughts.
For the personal assistants who followed Bentley, we now know more about what working for Combs entailed for them.
In recent weeks, the jury in Combs' federal criminal trial has heard from five former employees of Combs' who served as his assistant for all or some of their time working with him. Through their testimony, which in some cases was delivered under immunity agreements, prosecutors aim to prove Combs' used his businesses and staff in service of a criminal enterprise in which the government claims Combs engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice between 2008 and 2024.
Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
Derek Watkins, Bentley's given name, stopped working for Combs in 2004, four years prior to any allegations in the federal case. He has not been named in any civil litigation or the criminal case against Combs. But his role in Combs' life has not gone unmentioned by trial observers who have made a sport of dissecting Combs' old media appearances in search of clues that might answer the questions playing out in court: What exactly did Diddy do?
During a 2004 late-night TV conversation with Conan O'Brien, Combs raved about Watkins, a dapper gentleman who was famously once photographed holding an umbrella for Combs to shield him from the St. Tropez sun. At the time of the interview, Watkins was no longer employed by the music mogul.
'He's an entrepreneur,' Combs said of Watkins. 'He's moved on to bigger and better things.'
But it was what Combs said later in the conversation that has some people wishing Watkins would say more about his time working for Combs.
O'Brien asked the music mogul about his practice of sending someone from his staff to hotels ahead of his stays to prepare his room.
'It's called 'preparing the sexy,'' Combs explained. 'I definitely take pride in being the originator of the preparation of the sexy.'
Combs said that entailed having candles, flowers and a specific scent in his rooms.
Prosecutors have painted a different picture about alleged incidents years later.
Details around so-called 'Freak-Offs' and 'hotel nights' between 2008 and 2024 have been central to the prosecution's case against Combs in testimony from his former assistants, the alleged victims and male entertainers paid to participate in some of the alleged drug-fueled sexual encounters.
The first time Combs' former executive assistant George Kaplan was tasked with setting up a hotel room for Combs, he was given a bag and told to unpack it, he testified last month. The bag had clothes, a speaker, candles, liquor, baby oil and Astroglide, said Kaplan, who testified under an immunity order. After that first time, he said he would often buy the same supplies with his corporate credit card.
Kaplan testified that after Combs would leave a hotel room, he'd go in and pack up Combs' belongings and tidy up. On one occasion, he cleaned up a 'brown crystallized powder' off a countertop, though he said he didn't know what it was.
Asked why he didn't let the hotel staff clean up, Kaplan said he came to understand part of his role was protecting Combs' image.
'Protecting him and protecting his public image was very important and that was something I was very keen on doing,' he said.
Watkins has not spoken publicly about the allegations against Combs.
CNN reached out to Watkins and his former representatives for comment.
Watkins, like others once close to Combs, has seemingly moved on.
Watkins married and had kids. His infrequent social media presence is a collection of tributes to other entertainment artists, sponsored posts from brands like Lego and the occasional inspirational message.
'How your life feels is much more important than how it looks,' an Instagram post from Watkins, shared last year, reads.
Of course, Watkins' time in Combs' circle was, at least then, very important to him.
It was Watkins' distinct style - tailored three-piece suits and colorful ties - that sparked his introduction to Combs. During a 'Shade 45 Morning Show' conversation in 2009, Watkins recalled bumping into Combs at events around 2001 in New York City, where Watkins had moved from Atlanta and was then working at Ralph Lauren's flagship store.
The two would talk fashion and those interactions led to them exchanging numbers. Watkins decided to appeal to the entrepreneur's shared sense of ambition, he said. (Combs had clawed his way up himself by leaving Howard University to intern for Uptown Records).
'I just picked up the pager (and wrote), 'You remember that guy that traveled from Howard University to intern with (Uptown Records head) Andre Harrell? I'm that guy in 2001,'' Watkins told the radio show's host Angela Yee.
Combs told him to come to work and sent him an address, according to Watkins.
'I literally started training that day as his assistant,' he added. 'The rest is history.'
There may not be anyone more visibly linked to Combs at the height of his success and the tabloid culture of the early 2000s than Watkins. 'Fonzworth Bentley' was a nickname from Combs and one of his associates that became a public persona, as Watkins was photographed with Combs at events and appeared on the MTV reality show 'Making the Band 2.'
He was also deridingly compared in some press to a 'manservant,' a term Watkins disliked.
Critics of their professional dynamic believed seeing Watkins 'subservient' to the mogul was a painful reminder of a time when those types of positions were all that were available to African Americans.
In a 2004 interview with the New York Times, Watkins brushed off the criticism as handily as he would lint on a lapel.
'A pioneer always looks crazy until he finds dry land,' he told the publication.
'He was never a manservant. He had a very respectable job, and when he held up an umbrella for me, that was his idea, because it's entertainment,' Combs said in a 2017 interview. 'And he knows I don't like to get hot.'
Watkins' post-assistant projects included hosting MTV's 'From G's to Gents,' a makeover series for aspiring gentlemen. He appeared in rap duo OutKast's 'The Way You Move' and 'Roses' music videos and had a small role in the 2006 film 'Idlewild.'
Watkins also had parts in the movies 'Honey' and 'Fat Albert.' He launched a line of high-end umbrellas and authored the etiquette book, 'Advance Your Swagger: How to Use Manners, Confidence and Style to Get Ahead.'
His former boss helped influence him getting into the music industry. Watkins rapped on Da Band's 2002 album 'Too Hot for TV' and in a skit on Outkast's famed album 'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.'
He released his debut album 'C.O.L.O.U.R.S' in 2011, but it was Kanye West who gave him the most visibility in the music industry.
West featured Watkins on his album 'The College Dropout' and gave him a songwriting credit on the 2013 album 'Yeezus.' He has continued contributing to creative projects in the entertainment industry, more recently on shows like 'Black-ish.'
In a 2022 interview with Forbes, Watkins described how he works with fellow artists.
'It's really about listening and being aware, and being present, but also being able to understand that artist and understand their fears and insecurities,' Watkins said. 'It's also about being able to see something in them that they may not see in themselves that I help unearth.'
He also reflected on his time working for Combs two decades prior.
'How Sean Combs runs his life is like a consigliere,' Watkins said. 'He really does live like the 'Godfather, Part II.''

entertainment,Raducanu not satisfied with level at Queen's after quarter-final exit,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IW6CC3EMFBOTHBA5MR6ET67KQA.jpg?auth=5f099cb1e197b907fdb6a553b456bd6b303bc0fa791523d34ad26930334d29dd&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/raducanu-not-satisfied-with-level-queens-after-quarter-final-exit-2025-06-14,"Emma Raducanu said she was not too pleased with the level she displayed in her 6-2 6-4 defeat to Zheng Qinwen at the Queen's Club Championships on Friday, but the Briton dismissed any fears of a serious back injury.
In an entertaining battle, Raducanu had a few bright moments and secured a double break to go 3-0 up in the second set after taking a medical timeout for a back issue, but she was eventually overpowered by the Chinese world number five.
""I've played five matches in a pretty short amount of time. I'm probably feeling that, so I need to let the back rest and see how it goes from there,"" Raducanu, who also competed in the doubles alongside Katie Boulter, told the BBC after her defeat in London.
""I'm not overly concerned that (the back issue) is something serious, but I know it's something that's very annoying and needs proper and careful management.
""I've improved a lot and done a lot of good work behind the scenes, but there's a lot to go to get to the next level. They are stronger than me and have had more time training - I need to do the same. I need to raise my level.""
Raducanu is next scheduled to compete at the German Open in Berlin as she continues her preparations for Wimbledon.",
