            <p class="lead">We sincerely appreciate your time and input in this study where we aimed to explore how people perceive and engage with transparency information.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the experiment, you were shown several news articles. Some of those might have included an <span class="highlight">image label</span>. This label was designed to help you assess how trustworthy and verifiable the images were.</p>
            <p>Participants were shown either no label or one of the different kinds of labels below. Using a variety of labels helped us test how design and presentation affect understanding and choices.</p>
            <p>The transparency score was based on factors such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether the <strong>image’s author</strong> is known,</li>
                <li>If the image includes <strong>verifiable metadata</strong> (e.g., location, time, edits),</li>
                <li>And whether there's a clear <strong>edit history</strong> or usage trace.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You may have seen the label in a <strong>collapsed</strong> (small icon) and <strong>fully expanded version</strong> with detailed explanation.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Thank you again — your contribution helps us build better tools for transparency and trust in digital media.</p>
